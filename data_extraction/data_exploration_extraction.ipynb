      "You may laugh, but I have found that Otherland volumes 1-4 are poor at picking up debris around the house.  I once spilled some cornflakes on the floor, and foolishly thought that I could clean it up by dropping &#34;City of Golden Shadows&#34; on it.  Not only did it not clean, it managed to make things worse by fragmenting the cornflakes into smaller and smaller pieces.  I did what any normal person would do: I stacked the other books on top, hoping that the combined power would whisk the cornflakes away to the technological wonderland that is Otherland.  No such results.Bin Otherland Empty, on the other hand, works like magic.  If you hook it up to a powerful enough motor, you can banish those cornflakes to the land of wind and ghosts.  The downside is that it's pretty light reading, but given the young adult trend these days it's following the light reading trend that literature is headed for these days.It's recommended that you get through the previous volume though (&#34;Hoover Electrical Vaccum Unit&#34;).  I mean, Bin Otherland Empty does work as a stand-alone, but it's not quite as absorbing when not paired up with the prequel.  Some people think you can skip the previous volume and lust stick your mouth in at one end and suck, but, c'mon, that's just gross.Spoiler alert!  Cornflakes vaccumed up.\n",

I come to this topic from both a Christian background and intellectual skepticism. But in the past fifteen years I have been exposed to and come to see the value of several forms of oracle and divination as tools for tapping into the subconscious as well as whatever one chooses to believe about the unseen energies and spirits possibly involved. I have often experienced remarkable outcomes and guidance from Runes, I Ching, and various forms of Tarot Cards, and have come to trust and value my own gifts of intuition. It was exciting to see what I have experienced with \"divination\" and oracle tools so well summed up and explained.This is an attractively laid-out, beautifully illustrated book that is impressively distinct from many coffee-table type overview \"encyclopedias\" on various subjects for actually having something useful and insightful to say. So many of these type of books are rushed into print to take advantage of popular (and superficial) interest in a given subject and are mostly cheap eye candy with shallow content and often misinformation. What impressed me most about this book is the author\\'s knowledgeable and balanced presentation. He is not dismissive of religion, but he is forthright about how religion and mainstream culture have repressed alternative realities and methods throughout history. This book is not full of gushy New-Age-speak.

It is not Orwell or Huxley, so expecting the writing to fly off the page and create a vivid, disturbing world is completely unrealistic. That said, the writing was oftentimes slightly disappointing when compared with the other novels.Getting immersed in the novel is troublesome: it is halting and stuttering for the first half. Roth seems to have lost her rhythm and keeps throwing the exact same obstacle at her characters disguised as different problems (A rebellion here... a rebellion here... a rebellion here... a rebellion here... it is an interesting look into a country that's collapsing, but it becomes quite too predictable).As interesting as it was stylistically to switch chapters between Tris and Tobias's point of views, that creates a disjoint: there is none of the continuity of the first two books. Once you're immersed in Tris's narrative, her chapter ends, and suddenly you are forced to remove yourself from her brain and try to enter Tobias's head. Also, the style of voice for each character isn't quite differentiated enough to really allow this separation to fully take place. There were times when I would forget whose head I was in, and it was simply because the style did not change enough to move me from one to another.However, having finished the book, the conceit makes more sense. We had to have a look into Tobias's head.As for those who disparage Roth for ending it the way she did, I, too, was disappointed. Yet Tris always did things true to her character: things she had done in the first book and in the second. There was no other way for Roth to end the series and have Tris remain an authentic person. Sure, we all want a happy ending, but doing so would be a cop out. How likely would it be for a sixteen year old girl to survive all of the things Tris has survived? Not very. Add that to her self-sacrificing tendencies and what you get is exactly what Roth wrote. Was I angry? Yes. Heartbroken? Definitely? Did I spend the last eighty pages or so of the book crying, wiping my eyes, aware of what was going to happen? Yeah. But then again, I'm a writer, and as a writer, I would have been extremely frustrated if Roth had ended it happily for everyone. That's simply not realistic.So while I am sad that I didn't get the storybook ending a la The Hunger Games or Harry Potter, I am happy that, for once, an author was realistic about what would happen to a traumatized sixteen year old girl in extraordinary circumstances who has survived way longer than probable.\", 'overall': 4.0, 'summary': 'What did you expect?', 'unixReviewTime': 1382572800, 'reviewTime': '10 24, 2013'}\n"

No. There's an interval and then there's a second act, and then there's the end. So okay, this story has more than 2 acts. By the end it will have, maybe, 7. So it's not really fair to say 'these characters aren't important' or 'this was just a bridge' or 'we didn't get to the end' ...  because until we do reach the end, we can't tell.I believe Martin is the single greatest fantasy writer of our time. I think he will go down in history as one of the greatest, full stop. Was I frustrated at the long time between books 3 and 4? You'd better believe it. Am I sorry that some of my favourite characters didn't appear in Feast? Yes. I'm desperate to know what's happening with Tyrion. But that's what I get for not waiting till the completion of the series. I'm reading it in installments and not all my questions will be answered right away. One possible explanation for people's dissatisfaction is that this isn't a 'complete' novel the way books 1-3 are ... it is a single entity split in two. Is that a fault? Perhaps, but I'm not upset by it.Martin has spent 30 years honing his craft and perfecting his narrative skills, and I believe we as readers are reaping the benefits. I loved this book, and I eagerly look forward to the next part of the story.

Her strange sensitivity to light, and seeming ability to communicate with the family dog, are secondary concerns to the kids at her middle school who tease her for having an absent father. Despite gaining herself the nickname \"freaky Fern,\" she leads a generally happy life, thanks to her mother\\'s caring and her twinbrother Sam\\'s friendship.But one day in the middle of English, Fern simply disappears. No one can find her; no one has seen her leave the room, much less her desk. Unbeknownst to her classmates, Fern has somehow managed to teleport to Pirate Cove, her favorite part of a nearby beach. Frightened and unsure of how she got there, Fern tries to tell the truth, but her mother isn\\'t believing it and neither is the school\\'s headmaster. The next time she vanishes and reappears, it is to a much more dangerous location, and by then it\\'s impossible for Fern to keep her activities under wraps. It\\'s only after a series of dangerous accidents that Fern discovers the truth of her identity and the full extent of her powers as an \"otherworldly,\" the politically correct term for any creature that is not entirely human.Kogler does a wonderful job of detailing the average twelve-year-old\\'s insecurities and the way that they are magnified in Fern, who is anything but average. She presents a compelling picture of what it\\'s like to grow up different in a world where schoolchildren are cruel and ostracize people who don\\'t fit in. I found Fern, Sam, and their mother to all be very sympathetic and believable characters, whose motivations were easy to accept.I also enjoyed Kogler\\'s conception of the titular \"otherworldlies,\" which made this book refreshingly different from other vampire stories I have read. Her use of Greek myths as the starting point for a number of inhuman creatures and supernatural powers put a new spin on the traditional vampire myths.Overall, THE OTHERWORLDLIES was a satisfying read, with a plot that asked more questions than it answered but still managed to come to some kind of conclusion. Kogler\\'s left herself open for a sequel, perhaps even an entire series, about Fern\\'s future, and I for one look forward to whatever she comes up with next.Reviewed by:  Candace Cunard', 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': 'Courtesy of Teens Read Too', 'unixReviewTime': 1213920000, 'reviewTime': '06 20, 2008'}\n",

Ertle \"The Truth is Out There\"', 'helpful': [75, 101], 'reviewText': 'Well, I always thought that Good to Great was too good to be true. The author and his team picked several firms that exploded in the late 1980s compared with some selected \\'matched\\' firms that did not do well and tried to identify a set of criteria that they could identify to attribute cause to the effect (success). The problem is that with such retrospective analysis (this would be called a case-control study in clinical research) you can only identify differences and can never attribute cause and effect. These types of studies are inherently poorly resistant to biases inserted by the authors. Typically, they have a preconcieved notion of what they are looking for and then go find it in a self-fulfilling prophesy. This book is no different. The data is from public and published information like SEC reports, other published info, and interviews. The data is pretty subjective.I was wondering what happened to some of the \"great\" companies compared to the ones that were not great in the same industry (in clinical research, you would always pick two to four comparitor cases, rather than just one, to prevent bias, or to help prevent it). The reason to look was based on my glance at chart on page 2 where it was clear that the \"great\" companies were beginning to level off. Now we all know that there was a huge stock boom in the mid- to late- 1990s and that emotion and luck played as much a part in many success stories and were short lived. The book was published in 2001. What happened to those companies?So here is what I found (the first company is the \"great\" one):Walgreens traded at ~$40 in 2001 and about ~$46 now. Eckerd was purchased by J.C. Penny in 1999 while they were researching the book. Seems to be a crappy comparitor.Abbott traded at ~$46 in 2001 and about ~$42 now. Pharmacia was purchased by Pfizer in 2000 while the book was being written. Seems to be a crappy comparitor.Circuit City traded at ~$9 in 2001 and about ~$18 now. Silo went bankrupt in 1995. Seems to be a crappy comparitor.Kimberly-Clark traded at ~$65 in 2001 and about ~$60 now. Kimberly-Clark bought Scott Paper in 1995. Seems to be a crappy comparitor.Gillette traded at ~$34 in 2001 and about ~$55 now. Pfizer purchased Warner-Lambert in 2000 as the book was being written. Seems to be a crappy comparitor.Wells Fargo traded at ~$44 in 2001 and about ~$62 now. Bank of America traded at ~$20 in 2001 and about ~$45 now.Kroger traded at ~$24 in 2001 and about ~$19 now. A & P (Great A & P Tea) traded at ~$7 in 2001 and about ~$28 now.Thus, it seems that the attribution of cause and effect to the differences they found was a completely flawed methodology and probably has more complex solutions and reasons. It also shows that the authors had tremendous selection bias and compared the \"great\" firms with primarily those firms know to be doomed. Not a fair comparison. The ones that didn\\'t cease to exist seem to be doing as well to day as their \"great\" comparitors.Additionally, most of the concepts are recycled. Not bad ideas, but recycled with different jargon attributed to older ideas. The idea that leaders and managers should focus on what the firm and they do best, what they are passionate about, and what they can achieve rather than what they want to achieve is a great idea, but not new and it sure didn\\'t need to be called the hedgehog concept.', 'overall': 1.0, 'summary': 'Great until the Bubble Broke', 'unixReviewTime': 1132012800, 'reviewTime': '11 15, 2005'}\n"

I will start with the cover which by the way is beautiful and goes perfectly with the storyline. This book was beautifully written and the story had me crying and thinking that this is something that could happen to any one of us.Laurel is a junior in high school and full of life. She is a straight \"A\" student and has everything going for her. One night she and her family are on their way to their neighbor\\'s house and after dinner they decide to all go out to get some ice cream. Laurel doesn\\'t want to go and asks to go home instead. That was the last time she would see her mom, dad and little brother alive. Mr. Kaufman was the only one that survived but is now in a coma. David, Mr. and Mrs. Kaufman\\'s son had also decided not to go with them that night and just like Laurel, lived. Luckily for Laurel, her grandmother came to stay with her and took care of her, but poor David had lost his mom in the crash and his dad was in the hospital on life support and no one to help him with this tragedy. Now Laurel has to try to move on with her life and try to accept that her family is gone. The only problem is that it\\'s pretty hard when you are surrounded by things that trigger memories of the people she loved the most. Laurel keeps all her thoughts and emotions to herself and doesn\\'t let anyone know what\\'s she\\'s thinking, not even her best friend Meg. But for some reason, the only person she feels close to and comfortable with is David.This story is filled with emotions. I will admit that I cried and laughed at times.

I chose this book because I was curious to see if it was anything like Wuthering Heights (a book I rather enjoyed) writen by the other Bronte sister.Jane Eyre is a conflicted love story. It follows the life of, surprisingly, a woman named Jane. She lives a harsh childhood, first in the hands of an unloving aunt and her abusive son and then later in the confines of the deteriorating Lowood school. She resides at the school for 8 years and realizes that she wants to experience more of the world outside of the Lowood school. Jane then works as a nanny at a place called Thornfield where she falls in love with her master, Mr. Rochester.This love story is complicated and conflicted in that the love between Mr. Rochester and Jane is forbidden on more than one level.Jane Eyre was much more than I had expected. Although I enjoyed Wuthering Heights, I found Jane Eyre to be much more engaging. At many times, while reading this novel, I found myself completely frustrated yet intrigued and eager to continue at the same time. Bronte evokes such emotion in this novel, from the harsh realities of Jane's childhood to the whirlwind romance between her and her master. I found Mr. Rochester's courtship of Jane to be the most entertaining. I found Jane's confusion and reluctance to be frustrating, yet thought-provoking. And I found the separation of the two to be vexing and upsetting. Ironically, I found the ending to be strange, yet fitting in a story of constant ups and downs.

And what a shadowy and unseemly world it is: hired researchers devoid of ideological basis save the almighty dollar, sources with questionable motives, and in general people willing to stop at nothing to dredge up \"the truth\" on opposing candidates.  What results is a vast wonderland of mirrors: what is the truth, how do well \"sell\" candidates, how do you reveal \"the truth\" about your opponent in the most unflattering way?  \"We\\'re With Nobobdy\" is replete with numerous examples of the lengths to which opposition researchers will go to dig up dirt, the unsavory characters they utilize to get that dirt, and the people who serve that dirt up.  Meanwhile voters claim to express distaste for the dirt served up, yet lap it up with a voraciousness that would make Caligula blush.  \"We\\'re With Nobody\" is a scathing indictment and exposure of opposition research, but ultimately an expose without an end goal.

Rephann \"curious about everything\"', 'helpful': [162, 171], 'reviewText': 'The way this book is written&#65533;at times light, nurturing, and joyous but often heavy, challenging, and confrontational&#65533;is a metaphor for Scott Peck\\'s perspective on life. The first sentence of the book, \"life is difficult,\" reflects Scott Peck\\'s idea that spiritual/mental growth must be worked towards, that human beings are generally lazy, and that growth of consciousness is a life-long process. Everything is generally working against our growth: laziness; defense mechanisms employed to maintain the status quo of mental illness over the struggle for accepting responsibility; confusion over the true nature of love; resistance to \"grace\"  (the idea of being open to our unconscious and the symbolic language of God); lack of discipline; adults being mentally and spiritually immature; poor parenting resulting in nuerosis and character disorder; and a culture that generally defends, accepts, and nurtures sickness over health.Sometimes Scott Peck\\'s language is a little heavy, but it\\'s only because he packs so much valuable information and insight into each page. The first chapter on Discipline (a tool to solve our problems. Another great Peck idea: see problems as challenges, and it is in our response to problems that life takes on its meaning and color) was a bit dry to me, but contains excellent information on delaying gratification, balancing and bracketing (attempting to listen to others/view situations with objectivity), dedication to the truth, and a key to anyone seeking to grow: ACCEPTING RESPONSIBILITY.The second section on Love was fascinating to me. Scott Peck does a great job debunking the myth of romantic love, but perhaps most valuable is the idea that real loving is about nurturing your own or another\\'s spiritual growth. Love is an action and a decision, not just a feeling. It\\'s so easy in our culture to imagine love as a feeling, red roses, wine, dinners, etc. That is the illusion of romance but has nothing to do with the work and courage of real active loving (Scott Peck says if an action doesn\\'t involve courage or work, it\\'s not loving!). Also in this chapter are a few controversial ideas, namely open marriage (Scott Peck\\'s extension of the idea that loving involves encouraging an individual\\'s total development...hmmm...sort of vague extension to me to involve plural relationships. what happened to discipline?) and even Scott Peck\\'s suggestion that he would have sex with a patient if he felt it would further both their spiritual development! (do not agree with this at all. any person in treatment is not in a position to navigate such power dynamics)The final section on Grace reminds us to look to our unconscious for information and guidance. Dreams, nagging thoughts, sudden insights, etc. from our unconscious, which Scott Peck says knows more than our conscious ever could, are signs that there is a God, and he/she/it is a loving God interested in our spiritual development (reflection of Scott Peck\\'s idea of love, and a good idea if you ask me). These signs are meant to prod us into action.In general, although at times you will be re-reading pages to make sure you got the meaning, and sometimes Scott Peck\\'s language will seem heavy and plodding, this book will help you see where you can expand the boundaries of your spirit, your mind, and your life, how you can love bigger and better (and make it mean more to everyone), how your life can have meaning and consistency, and how to be a loving, conscious person, parent, lover, mate, and friend. I underlined a LOT in this book, and going back to read just my underlines I am amazed at the amount of loving, valuable insight in this book. Growing and truly accepting responsibility for the quality of our lives is not as easy as it sounds. Scott Peck is very aware of this and gives a lot of support to keep on journeying this road less traveled.', 'overall': 4.0, 'summary': 'worth the effort', 'unixReviewTime': 1046822400, 'reviewTime': '03 5, 2003'}\n"

In a \"success\" scenario, if corn at harvesting time cost 50 cents less per unit of transaction (say, per 5000 bushels) than its cost at planting time, and the difference between contract prices (for the same amount of crop) sold and bought at planting and harvesting times, respectively, was also 50 cents, then the farmer would have made a successful hedge.There are many things one needs to know in order to become a successful commodity futures and option contract trader.  This book provides a good grounding in: knowing what a futures and an option contract is and how they\\'re different, how trading such instruments are different from, say, trading stocks, pros and cons of futures and option contract trading compared to stock trading, what goes into contract specifications, quotes, and profit and loss calculations for different commodities (e.g., delivery / expiration dates, what a trading unit represents [e.g., 1 contract of corn futures = 5000 bushels], how price movements are quoted [e.g., in cents or dollars], dollar value of each price unit movement [e.g., a penny change in corn futures contract price = $50], etc.)Adding commodities to one\\'s investment portfolio is usually thought of as a diversification strategy / opportunity.  Direct trading of commodity futures and option contracts, which in my opinion requires considerably more skills and knowledge than buying and selling mutual funds or stocks, however, is not the only way to get exposure to commodities investment or trading opportunities. Other avenues include buying and selling commodities-related mutual or exchange traded funds, or stocks of, say, commodity producing companies such as mining companies.  I\\'m not sure why the author focused on futures and option contract trading heavily in a book meant for helping beginners get started with commodities, but in my opinion, including a discussion of those other avenues would have added value to this beginners\\' book.Other types of information missing from, but could add value to, this book include:  discussion of the potential usefulness of trading simulators that help beginners get a feel for futures and option contract trading using virtual rather than real money and a sampling of the companies that provide such educational opportunities; references to other useful books or resources such as commodity-specific trade association web sites; or perhaps even a sampling of companies that provide futures and option contract trading services in addition to the author\\'s company, DeCarley Trading.An introductory book that covers more than Commodity Futures and Option Contract Trading as well as the other types of information I\\'ve mentioned above as missing from this book is Scott Frush\\'s Commodities Demystified.  Published in 2008, it\\'s a more engaging and easier read than this book but small parts of it may no longer be up to date (for example, the Top 25 Commodity Mutual Funds listing may no longer be valid); however, the concepts discussion is still valid and quite good.', 'overall': 4.0, 'summary': 'Narrowly focused on Futures and Option Contract Trading', 'unixReviewTime': 1268438400, 'reviewTime': '03 13, 2010'}\n"

A memoir by Ariel Dorfman, the novelist, the exile, living now with his family in Durham, North Carolina, where he holds the Walter Hines Page chair at Duke University.  To a certain extent I did like it, but the author comes over as a smarmy  busy-bee who pokes his nose into everything and inevitably gets himself  into trouble.  He sounds like a nave adolescent, full of himself, pathetic  despite his experiences and accomplishments.  He is an idealist, a quirky  character, a good writer, no doubt an eccentric.What is most incredible  is that the man now lives in the USA despite all his criticism of the  country's influence on the Third World in such books as How to Read Donald  Duck.  A bonus point for the USA for letting him stay, I'd say.  This is  not to say that Dorfman is incorrect in his assumptions though, rather it  begs the question of why did he choose to live in the US?  No doubt, it is  where he is most likely to draw attention to himself, have his books  published, and hold a secure position!  In that he's not much different to  the rest of us at heart, only differing insofar as his writing and exile is  concerned.Heading South, Looking North is an account of Dorfman's  early years in the US, his life in Chile, his involvement during the  Allende years, his struggle with language, namely American English and  Latin American Spanish, and finally his exile from Chile where this book  ends.The chapters alternate between his early years and the Allende  years, before he brings it all together in the closing chapter.  The  writing is often in the present tense and meanders and grinds on and on,  thereby it is easy to lose a grasp of what's being said.  Nonetheless, I  quite liked the style, though much of the time I couldn't see what the fuss  of whether to use Spanish or English was about.  Well, so it's difficult to  be fluent and think and write in both languages.  This is a writer's  dilemma, his agony so to speak, but it's no big deal.  That is unless you  want to make it one, and Dorfman does.  Whatever, he seems to succeed in  his efforts to write in both languages.I feel he uses that theme here  as an overburdened vehicle to the Allende years and his involvement in the  revolution.  A guy like this is bound to be involved in some sort of  revolution or other.  And in this book his supposed squeaky clean honesty  reminds me of modern day politicians, who I do not trust.  I'd be watching  my back if Dorfman was around for sure, he protests too much and I feel  there is definitely something he is not saying although he is supposed to  be saying it all.I look forward to reading a novel by him though.\", 'overall': 3.0, 'summary': 'Mixed feelings', 'unixReviewTime': 937526400, 'reviewTime': '09 17, 1999'}\n"

I have read every single one of his books, bar none.  Bar none, this was poorest book he has ever written.  The settings, characters, and story line are classic -- you can pick almost everyone of them out of his previous WW II era novels.  It has a lot of plot similarities to Eye of the Needle and Jackdaws.However, the overall plot is extremely predictable.  You can see just what is going to happen after reading the first 25%.  The details however revolve time and time and time again on a  whole series of coincidences which is very out of character for Follett.  I liked most of his books because the story line follows a logical flow with interesting bobs and weaves stemming from an initial premise.  This was more like a low budget movie where things happen by coincidences and characters survive by inches or seconds so many times it becomes unbelievable and ridiculous.The climatic seen of the flight to England has to be the absolutely worst piece of writing ever by Follett.  The events are ridiculous, the characters repeatedly make stupid errors, and the whole thing plays like a cheap B movie.  For instance, are we to believe that the only character who knows how to fly the plane falls asleep during a night flight over water half an hour after almost being shot out of the sky -- and the inexperienced person that's awake lets her sleep?  Or the king of them all, are we to believe the character waits till the airplane is within minutes of running out of gas before remembering to add the extra can of gas he has in the cockpit -- which he could have done 4 hours earlier?  Or how about delaying a day the flight that will change the war and save thousands of lives so that the main character can go to the ballet?  Or how about the German guard helping push the plane out for takeoff because he can't put two and two together?  He must not be related to the other character that can throw a cigar into the cockpit of a small airplane at takeoff speed.Come on Mr. Follett, you can do better.

There are paragraph- to page-sized entries on a wide variety of subjects, listed in alphabetical order.  If you\\'re looking for a good cover-to-cover read on Norse mythology, I highly recommend H. R. Ellis Davidson\\'s \"Gods and Myths of Northern Europe\".I own three of these dictionary-style books on Norse mythology, probably THE three such books: Lindow (this book), Rudolf Simek\\'s \"Dictionary of Northern Mythology\" and Andy Orchard\\'s \"Dictionary of Norse Myth & Legend\" (or whatever the current publisher\\'s calling it these days).Of the three, Lindow is by far the most accessible and user-friendly to the layperson.  There\\'s a wealth of information here, and it\\'s written and presented very well and with a healthy amount of humor (one doesn\\'t often see the poem \"Thrymskvida\" described as featuring \"Thor in drag\").That said, it\\'s also true that this book doesn\\'t contain the hoard of detailed, otherwise obscure information that Simek and Orchard have to offer.  On more than one occasion I went to look up something in Lindow and was surprised that it wasn\\'t there.  For example, I find it odd that there\\'s an entry for Ratatosk (a squirrel that inhabits the world tree Yggdrasil, a relatively minor character), but not one for, say, Svartalfaheim (in some accounts, one of the Nine Worlds of Norse mythology, realm of the \"black elfs\", or dwarfs).The bottom line is, if you have a casual interest in Norse mythology and want a well-written, simple reference, then Lindow\\'s your man.  If you want practically everything there is to know about Norse mythology that\\'s available in English, well, Simek or Orchard are probably your best bet.But even if you\\'re going whole hog and decide to get Simek or Orchard, get Lindow too, if for no other reason than that he\\'s an absolute blast to read.', 'overall': 4.0, 'summary': 'Excellent as a jumping-off point', 'unixReviewTime': 1185667200, 'reviewTime': '07 29, 2007'}\n",

The story is a sequel to an earlier book The Earl of Rayne's Ward, where we first meet Viscount Linford (who has &quot;lost&quot; his wife). In this book, we find out exactly how this happened.It is not a spoiler to say that Viscount Linford married his wife when she was just 16 and married only for her money (promised him by her miserly and misanthropic father), since this appears in the first chapter. We soon learn that he was a rather dissolute rake, but has changed his ways. Linford visits his aunt in London and is introduced to her entrancing friend, Mrs Emily Stowen, who is apparently a widow of means. However, it turns out that Mrs Stowen is neither a widow nor all that unknown to him. If you have read a few romances, you will guess her identity even before the hero does.The rest of the story is taken up with the attempts of Lord Linford to win back his wife through means fair and foul, and how Lady Linford finds her place as chatelaine of a great country estate, despite the machinations of a rather nasty neighbor. There is a sub-plot involving attempted rape and murder, and blackmail, although most of the story is focused around the growing friendship between Linford and his wife.My main problem with the story is that I found a couple of secondary characters - a young neighbor Lucy Maitland (and her family dynamics), and a retired Bow Street runner - far more interesting than the hero and heroine. When this happens, even a decent story loses its attraction. However, this might not happen to you.Anne Ashley writes a competent Regency romance, with nothing really jarring.

Hotchner, that revealed to the world upon its publication in 1966 that Ernest Hemingway died in 1961 not of an accident while cleaning a gun but of an intentional self-inflicted gunshot. If that was all this book had to offer the world on Hemingway, it would not still be in print.  He provides an up close and personal portrait of a man he admired and called a good friend, but a complicated personage all the same.  This is not a critical, exhaustively researched biography weighing 10 pounds; it is memoir by someone who experienced life with the man firsthand, an account that comes across with honesty and enough detail for readers to draw their own critical conclusions.Hotchner was a young writer dispatched by a magazine in 1948 to find the by then world famous Hemingway in Cuba and negotiate an article.  Hotchner's terror at the assignment turned into high surprise as Hemingway took to him and brought him right into his inner circle.  Hotchner never talks about himself really, so we don't know what Hemingway saw in him, but it had to be something because Hemingway was not a man who trusted easily, who required exacting standards in his pals, who also included restaurateur Toots Shor, Marlene Dietrich, Gary Cooper and Ava Gardner.  Hemingway was at the top of his powers in 1948, living as he thought life should be lived and settled in with his fourth and last wife, Mary, who could stand up to him.  On the pretense of editing work, he takes Hotchner along for European adventures, making fun while also disclosing memories of his earlier days, and most important, what inspired his classic novels.  As they move into the 1950's together, Hotchner also catches evidence of Hemingway's battle with mortality.  He has a tough road back to health after surviving a plane crash in Africa, and then, trying to work again, he is bowled over by the response to THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA (the Pulitzer) and the Nobel Prize.

The first-person narrative is such a bold move because it immediately gives a sense of autobiography that a lesser writer would have come across as merely self-indulgent. Yet, he invents an academic figure to \"write\" the foreword - Jakob Haarhuis, a fictional professor of Japanese at NYU, provides an explanation for how the memoirs are gathered, that they are the taped memoirs of the protagonist Sayuri.While it\\'s obvious that Golden has done his research, what takes the book to a higher level is the way he penetrates the psyche of the people caught within the orbit of this cloistered world. The story follows the life of Chiyo, a nine-year old Japanese girl who is sold into slavery along with her older sister Satsu. Because of her unusual grey eyes, Chiyo is then sold to an okiya (boardinghouse for geishas). The scenes in the okiya are Golden\\'s most meticulous and accomplished, especially as Chiyo undergoes a grueling apprenticeship and competes with the beautiful, worldly but wholly spiteful Hatsumomo, who is the okiya\\'s star geisha. Men become bewitched by her poise and subservient manner, and she takes her new name, Sayuri, symbolizing her metamorphosis into a professional geisha. Surviving some unsavory escapades with some of the okiya\\'s most undesirable patrons, Sayuri surpasses Hatsumomo in stature and becomes the mistress of the man she had set her heart on all along, the benevolent chairman of an electrical supply company.While a more predictable story would have stopped there with the love story, the author goes further and has Sayuri move to New York to run a salon for visiting Japanese businessmen until the chairman dies. In a certain way, I wish Golden did stop the book in Japan when WWII ends in the story. The chapters afterward feel rushed as if the author is losing interest in her story and wants the reader to get to the inevitable ending quickly. Regardless, Golden fills the book with vivid images and subtle descriptions of the nuances of Japanese culture. Absolutely invaluable in its detail if sometimes too overwhelming to appreciate at once (a repeated reading is recommended), the story reflects a brilliant eye for the customs and rituals within geisha society, including its politics, rivalries, and traditions. Having been to the historic Gion district of Kyoto, where present-day geishas still live, I have caught a glimpse of these women scurrying about in their beautiful kimonos looking both fetching and anachronistic. Golden captures their stories with compassion and an anthropologist\\'s fervor. This is strongly recommended both as fiction and an essential ingredient of Japan\\'s cultural history.', 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': \"Behind the White Mask Lie Further Layers of Subverted Identity in Golden's Sharply Observed Novel\", 'unixReviewTime': 1131753600, 'reviewTime': '11 12, 2005'}\n",

The characters again have that melodramatic quality that a noir atmosphere seems to need.

Obviously hard to find unless one uses Protestant books. I purchased this book, but immediately felt disappointed. I am an at-home, homeschooling, very traditional Catholic woman, and some of the reflections rubbed me the wrong way, or were hard to relate to, because they were so contemporary and did not seem universal enough to apply to my life. They also struck me less as meditations and more as anecdotes. However, after awhile, the book began having an unexpected effect on me which, while different than I expected, was positive nonetheless. While I could not relate to some of the anecdotes or reflections, I did find myself learning more and more about how to apply scripture to my life, beyond the obvious ways the Church has always taught. It was as if, by relating the experiences and thoughts of other women, the book was giving me permission to insert my own story, my own sufferings and struggles and joys, into salvation history. So, while I do not find myself meditating on the given reflections in the way I expected, they DO inspire meditation! A second positive effect is, I find myself obsessively reading scripture out of curiosity as to what the next reflection will be! Three words of caution: First, while some reflections are only a page or two apart, occasionally there are many pages between daily reflections. In that case, one must make a choice of reading many pages, or skip large sections of the Bible to keep pace with the sequence of reflections. Second, there are a few reflections which are questionable in terms of theological accuracy. One example describes Christ\\'s birth as involving pain, blood, and an umbilical cord, which sounds to me like a denial of the Virgin Birth. Another cautions us against allowing our religious rituals to come between us and another person; this can be read in an acceptably orthodox way as advising us not to be too rigid, but could also be read as permission to skip Mass in the name of charity. Third, I am personally not fond of the inclusive-language translation of the NRSV. I realize it is approved by the Church, but sometimes in the awkward effort to use inclusive language, the meaning is diluted or completely altered. For example, sometimes the word \"man\" is used not simply to refer generically to any human being, but is meant to refer to Adam, either literally or figuratively. Therefore, changing it to \"person\" or \"humankind\" loses some of the intended meaning. As does the use of \"students\" in place of \"brothers\"; clearly those words are not synonymous. Thankfully, there are footnotes indicating the original words whenever these alterations are used. But these alterations seem unnecessary; I don\\'t know of any woman who has ever been offended by the original language of the Bible, which was, after all, authored by God. Overall, a worthwhile book. I would like to see a somewhat different version for women, perhaps drawing more heavily upon women saints than contemporary authors, and with reflections which are more truly meditative than anecdotal,using a non-incusive-language text.', 'overall': 4.0, 'summary': 'Grew To Like This Book', 'unixReviewTime': 1167350400, 'reviewTime': '12 29, 2006'}\n",

If you have ever listened to Governor Romney speak, this book reads like a long speech. It is readily comprehensible, plainly spoken, and frequently well versed.It is so named because Obama\\'s apology tours, denigrating America, are well known, and heinous for any American elected or appointed official to do, much less for the President of America. Obama should apologize for apologizing, and the best way for America to ensure he does that is to support great folks like Mitt Romney.Sometimes this book is not well versed.He addresses many problems facing America today. Overall he addresses them well, with some disagreements, some ignorance, some shortchanging, and some omissions.He names Russia, China, and Islamofascism as the three main foreign policy threats we face, plus he includes the somewhat minor actors such as Chavez in Venuesuela, Kim in North Korea, etc.His call for ensuring that Iran does not acquire nuclear weapons is stirring, but not stirring enough. His call for an anti-missile defense system is good, but not good enough. His warning of the threat of an Electro Magnetic Attack (EMP) on the US is brief; it is over in one mild paragraph. He does not really tie these three together as he should have. He does not really elaborate on what Iran and the rest of the world could/would do if Iran does become a nuclear power.He does not mention that we need a perfect anti-missile defense system to deter an EMP attack, for which we would only have 30 seconds warning from launch to detonation, and that is not enough time to react except automatically. Three missiles launched from three container ships off of our coasts could successfully send most of the USA back to the stone age with only 30 seconds warning, and Iran could mount such an attack.He does not cover, as Newt Gingrich does, as Mike Huckabee does, and the Heritage Foundation does, and as the Clarion Foundation does, how a successful EMP attack on the USA would be a civilization killer. He says we would be without electricity, but he doesn\\'t say that it would last for two or three years, and that over 90% of all Americans would die in the first year due to starvation, disease, and violence as civilization totally collapsed. I recommend \"One Second After\" by Newt Gingrich\\'s frequent co-author, William Forstchen, which, in novelization form as no attack has yet happened, is an accurate representation of the danger such an attack would be.Romney does not elaborate on how to keep Iran from accquiring nuclear weapons, what we shoud do besides toothless sanctions, or what to do if Iran does acquire nuclear weapons, which the Obama administration will allow Iran to do (i.e. will do nothing to deter or stop them).He covers all bases regarding Climate Change, coming down, sort of, on the side of adapting to climate change, rather than implementing a job killing tax increasing ponzi scheme like cap and trade. However, one has to question whether this is a subject the Governor really studied, for if he had, he would know that climate change is entirely natural; that CO2 is not the causative factor in climate change, and that man is not the cause either. As the East Anglia E-mails state, there has been 15 years of global cooling - is that also caused by CO2? It is a shame that the Governor really didn\\'t do his homework on this subject.Governor Romney has read \"America Alone\", by Mark Steyn, which covers the demographics that are going to turn most of the rest of the world\\'s countries into Islamist countries well before the end of this century. He has called it a powerful book, and has recommended that all members of his staff read it. The operative question is whether or whether not the USA can survive as the last Western Civilization country on this Earth.Governor Romney does not address how to keep the Chechen Muslims, like those who took over the Belsan school and slaughtered over 100 kids, from taking over Russia. What kind of threat will an Islamist Russia with all of their nuclear capablilities be? He doesn\\'t address the Threat from all of Western Europe becoming an Islamist continent, including nuclear armed France, overrun by the Muslim Brotherhood (who tried to blow up the twin towers in 1993), and what kind of threat that will be to America\\'s security. He doesn\\'t address the Threat of nuclear armed England, when the Deobondi sect of Islam (the Pakistan version of the Wahhabi sect that all 19 of the 9/11 killers adhered to) takes over England. He doesn\\'t address the threat of Islamist Canada being overrun by Wahhabism and becoming a springboard for invading the USA by these Islamists around the world. He doesn\\'t address the threat of large sections of Central and South America becoming Islamist countries. He doesn\\'t address the threat of Islam to the continued existence fo the USA as a non-Islamist country, and that becoming an Islamist country is a very, very bad event for our progeny. If we do lose this global war, as we are headed towards, and become an Islamist country, nothing, else, absolutely nothing else we are discussing today will matter.Governor Romney needs to spend some quality time with the U.S. House of Representatives Anti-Terrorism Caucus, chaired by Rep Sue Myrick (R-NC).As something needed to do to strengthen America, which he believes in firmly, fortunately, strengthening the traditional family, the real family, is a key part of his strategy and this book. His discussion of the actions needed is more thoruogh and detailed than even his economic analysis. This part of his book should be studied and his recommendations taken to heart by every American Politician of all political parties.Governor Romney has said on his book tour interview that this book is not about social values, and I accept his explanation.Overall, this is a worthwhile book, with many good recommendations. The flaws, and ignorance the Governor displays on some subjects, including the omissions, make this book deserving of a follow up book to properly address them.Governor Romney could have perfected this book without much more effort, and it\\'s a shame that he didn\\'t take the time to do it right in the first place.', 'overall': 3.0, 'summary': 'No apology is an apt title, but apologies are needed for omissions', 'unixReviewTime': 1268179200, 'reviewTime': '03 10, 2010'}\n",

I decided to try it this time with HALO.The summary on the inside sleeve of the book is decent enough to make you wanna read, and the first few chapters are quite easy to read through. There were times at the start of reading HALO that I was reading 5 chapters a day. I was impressed that Miss Adornetto was only 18-years-old when HALO was released. Her writing style was mature and descriptive. I was jealous at how easily writing seemed to come to her, when I\\'m older than her and struggle nearly every day to get my story ideas down on paper.However, getting past the angels settling in to their new environment, my opinion about HALO quickly went downhill. At first it was easy to look past Bethany\\'s naive in-take on everything, as this was her first time on earth and being human. But you\\'d think living in Heaven, watching humans live every day life from above would have given her a brain. I mean, you\\'d think instinctively she\\'d know right from wrong, but it was so easy for her to fall right into the role of being a teenager. Vanity and Xavier were the only things that mattered to her.There\\'s one part in HALO where Bethany attends her first teenaged house party, a party in which her beloved Xavier saves her from, and actually gets drunk off some alcohol because her brother Gabriel told her that humans have to keep hydrated.After the party Bethany starts to see Xavier more, sneaking out of the house one night to see him. It seems so easy for her to disobey her siblings and lose sight of their original reason for being on earth in the first place. She\\'s totally caught up in Xavier, thinking about him, talking about him, doing everything with him. It even gets to the point of not being able to exist without him. Xavier starts to annoy when he becomes overprotective of Bethany, insisting that she eat and drink regularly. As one reviewer said: he even plays airplane with her to get her to eat a power bar.Then, one day at school after talking to her girl friends, Bethany is influenced to bring up sex with Xavier, asking him if he\\'d ever thought about doing it with her and if he and his dead girlfriend Emily had a \"physical relationship\" too. This particular scene bothered me the most. Actually, Bethany brought up Emily a lot, wondering if she was as good as Emily.I found Bethany to be very weak and lacking a lot of faith. She often whined to Xavier, questioning his love for her and crying over the moment she\\'d have to return to Heaven, never to see or be with Xavier again. There\\'s one part that reminded me a lot of Bella from New Moon, just after Edward breaks up with her, where she\\'s depressed because she can\\'t live without her \"other half.\"Then there\\'s the new mysterious kid in school, Jake Thorne, who immediately gave me the impression he was bad news. Adornetto gave no mystery to this guy, describing him in dark clothing, long black hair and high cheek bones. Slowly but surely the goth students started to hang around him. There was no surprise when the rugby match came around and a dark figure stood across the field just before Xavier Woods took a fall and broke his leg and got a minor concussion. I knew right away it was Jake Thorne. Bethany acknowledged the figure but didn\\'t take much concern to it. You would think being an angel sent to earth to get rid of dark forces she could have sensed more from a dark force, which brings me to...Gabriel. When Jake attends the prom with Bethany due to the fact that Xavier had a concussion, he threatens her. Xavier says he can take Jake down but Gabriel insists that Jake is of dark forces, that no one knows exactly what he is or what he is capable of, that they need to find out first. He repeats this often, yet I never felt he put much effort into figuring out what exactly Jake was.Overall, I was disappointed in this book. I read it in a week and can\\'t believe I wasted my time. Luckily I only requested it free from the library. I wanted so badly to like this book, as the cover was amazing; I wanted to be able to have it on my book shelf. Apparently the picking-a-book-by-its-cover method doesn\\'t work for me as it does for my sister.HALO actually makes me feel angry every time I talk about it. The angels are weak; Bethany is too obsessive, too whine-y and too naive. Castiel from the TV show Supernatural isn\\'t as ridiculously stupid as these angels are. I do not recommend this book... unless you\\'re a huge fan of the Twilight saga and just want a story exactly the same, but instead of vampires and werewolves you get angels and demons.', 'overall': 1.0, 'summary': 'A beautiful cover with a fallen plotline', 'unixReviewTime': 1310083200, 'reviewTime': '07 8, 2011'}\n",

When I was about halfway finished, I ordered the hardcover copy, and the second book in the series -- it was just that good. I finally finished Kushiel\\'s Dart tonight, and felt inclined to write about it.This is not your typical fantasy. While there definitely are fantastic elements, there is no superhuman sorcery, no elves and goblins. Most of the fantasy in the book is reimagined history -- and that part is superbly done. It takes place in a Europe (Europa) of probably the 1000\\'s, with France (Terre d\\'Ange) being the most sophisticated country, more Renaissance-like than medieval. Much of the rest of the world, however, is delightfully primitive. Christianity is not dominate -- in fact, only a few Jew-like Christians are around in this world, although it is generally accepted by the French (D\\'Angelines) that there was a Jesus. England (Alba, which is definitely a well-researched name) is Pictish, and Germany is inhabited by barbarian Norsemen. The names for everything are perfect -- Hellas (Hellenism is the age of Alexander the Great) for Greece, Tiberium for Rome, Aragonia (think Ferdinand of Aragon) for Spain. It feels like she put a lot of thought into designing her world.The plot, too, is excellent. The main character is not your typical fantasy \"chick\" -- she doesn\\'t fight, magically or physically, and some things about her are almost repulsive. Pricked by Kushiel\\'s Dart, she feels pain as sexual pleasure -- and, thus, becomes very useful as a bed-partner to those with sadistic tastes. Still, I liked her quite a bit, and found her a very believable heroine. She saves her homeland -- through the use of her sexual skills, her beauty, and her wits.Plenty of people have criticized this book for being \"porn\". It really isn\\'t pornographic at all. There are vivid sex scenes, but they aren\\'t disgusting or pornographic. I wouldn\\'t recommend this book to a 12-year-old fantasy fan, but I wouldn\\'t warn anyone away from it due to the explicitness of the sex scenes.And the writing! The writing was just beautiful. Poetic, surpassing even the beauty of Tolkien. The heroine lives in a land of beauty and elegance, where every D\\'Angeline is descended from angels, and has their beauty. It follows that the language would be beautiful as well.An excellent book. Ten stars out of ten.

I have recently renewed my interest in the subject - hence my review.Read the book when it first came out and thought it was well written.

I was quietly made aware of their real mission and being young, naive and wanting to \"take it to the enemy\" thought it was a good idea. I was in command when COL R. made his inspection tour sometime in the Spring of 1969. I think 1LT Martin was off site but COL R. seemed to already know about his operation. LTC B, my immediate boss did not know about it and I had to fill him in on what little I knew. LTC B quickly understood and did not ask anymore questions. About the time I was preparing to leave for the States 1LT Martin was wrapping up his operation with a lot of haste. I had no idea what had happened until I returned to the States and heard about it on the news. Little did I know how close I was to such a historical event.

I picked up the series after reading other reviews, and looking for another fantasy author that writes to a high caliber. He didn't disappoint.The Night Angel series provides you with a living world, dynamic characters, interesting action, and hideous villains. The lines of morality are skewed with shades of grey throughout as the characters delve their own flaws and find themselves lacking. Like any of us, they are faced with the reality of their situations and grow to overcome many (but not all) of their flaws.Weeks writes with a very visual style, giving your imagination plenty, but not too much, information to go on. Cities are painted to reflect their hidden nature, castle halls come to life through the action, and forests seem to have their own storyline. It can be hard to put the series down once you've picked it up.Why four stars then? A matter of personal taste. Weeks delves into some deep psychological areas of his characters, and doesn't shy away from some dark matters. Rape, Cannibalism, Torture are all included, and in some ways normalized. He's also liberally uses profanity. All of it fits within the world and characters he's created -- very little of it was jilted outside of the story. If those things don't bother you inside of a good story, then you'll deeply enjoy the Night Angel series. If you can overlook them in the context of the story, you'll find a deep world that will have you thinking about the characters after you've closed the cover.

Now I personally have the balance and coordination of a drunken ostrich on a good day, so dancing isn't exactly my forte. But I love and respect the elegance of dance, both choreographed and improv. I admire the dedication people have to this sport; they constantly and consciously inflict damage and pain on their body to achieve that perfect move, that perfect moment. I found myself just as captivated by Sophie Flack's Bunheads as surely as if I were watching a live ballet.Watching dancers on stage or in a movie was one thing, but I wasn't sure about how I would enjoy reading about them. I often find that when a book revolves around a specific sport or hobby that isn't as well known, it can be somewhat offsetting to the reader. We don't understand the technical jargon that the writer casually tosses about, but I felt Flack handled herself wonderfully. If I didn't completely understand a move or maneuver, the rest of the description in the page was more times than not enough compensation. And while the novel does focus heavily on dance, it's so much more than that.Hannah struggles as a dancer translate easily to life. She's making decisions now as a young adult that will not only shape her career, but her life. After devoting her life to dance, Hannah starts to yearn for something more. While she still loves dance, she starts to realize she's missing the little things in life that we non-dancers take for granted regularly. When she meets Jacob she starts to really notice all those little things and that adds up into one big question: Can she have both ballet and a life of her own?With Flack's background as a dancer, this novel could have easily slid into the category of preachy and confusing. There is no doubt that Flack knows her stuff when it comes to ballet, but there's a fine line between knowing and writing. I must say that Flack danced that thin line with the finesse one would expect of a ballet dancer. This book is graceful, fast, and intoxicating to watch unfold.\", 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': 'The Irish Banana Review', 'unixReviewTime': 1324944000, 'reviewTime': '12 27, 2011'}\n",

Brown is a delightful read--one especially suited for those taking Web programming courses or wanting to learn the inside strategies on Web site design/programming preparation.The book starts off by covering the fundamentals of wireframes, personas, site maps, concept models, and flowcharts.  These components of the book are not only technical in a how-to format, but also practical in a business sense.  In fact, Dan Brown makes a point of stressing how to negotiate these \"deliverables\" in business meetings, in essence preparing the reader for a career in design strategies.The second part of the book not only emphasizes how to format the products (i.e., wireframes, personas, etc) into professional deliverables through providing structure for the reports, but also delves into competitive reviews, usability plans, and usability reports.  Of most interest to me was the competitive review, as it helped establish the framework (including site map) of a site I\\'m about to build.  One easily overlooked shortcoming of the book is that it doesn\\'t spend the time on research strategies, such as focus groups and interviews that the book A Project Guide To UX Design by Russ Unger does.  However, Communicating Design exceeds many other books in its elaboration on the personas, wireframes, site maps, flow carts, etc.--the actual deliverables.Although the book doesn\\'t delve into how to create the deliverables in different software programs (it only mentions a few of the usable programs like Illustrator and Microsoft Visio, for instance), one can go to Lynda.com for a month-to-month membership and access tutorials on these components.  Communicating Design shows, instead, how to create the different deliverables, how to conduct oneself in business presentations of the deliverables, and how to format them into impressive reports.It is also important to note that Dan Brown\\'s second edition felt more cumbersome at first, due to its wide size, but after spending time with the interior of the book, the read was quite pleasant.  The pages were glossed with lots of white space and friendly diagrams.Dan Brown\\'s book proved essential in helping me prepare for the initial design set-up of a Website, and I would argue that the steps he provides in his book are almost indispensable to making an excellent site.

It was a shock.  I assumed that everyone experienced music the same way.  Wrong!Do you ever ask anyone what happens when they hear music?  I didn't before I read this book.  Now I plan to ask everyone.Dr. Sacks has the kind of fine writing style and awareness of music that makes his tales seem as appealing as the cases that Dr. Sigmund Freud wrote about.  As Dr. Sacks pointed out, Dr. Freud didn't care for music so that gentleman failed to investigate and report on many of the phenomena in this book.We don't exactly know why the mind and body interact with music in the ways that they do.  Part is undoubtedly heredity.  Part is undoubtedly due to exposure to musical influences.  Some may relate to the language spoken in the home.  Difficulties with seeing may also be an influence.  Injuries to the body and brain can play a large role.  Dr. Sacks does a masterly job of using case after case to explore one aspect or another of these dimensions so that a complex picture emerges that's even more remarkable than the brain processes involved in reading.One of the biggest surprises in the book is that musical talent seems to be inhibited by some parts of the brain.  In similar way, music can also inhibit some other brain functions that we would like to get rid of.I had always wondered about those with perfect pitch, and the book explores that.  There are also wonderful sections on other seemingly inherited musical abilities.Dr. Sacks adds a lot of perspective to the history of music by making observations about various composers and the way that their compositions reflect certain musical abilities than others while explaining how the mental processes are different. Today, we can map the brain's activation in order to get clues about why certain behaviors are possible.  That final perspective adds a lot to the case histories.If you are like me, you'll find some of the cases to be heart-wrenching.  I was comforted a bit to realize that music made those sad lives better so there's reason to rejoice in that sense.So what was my big personal discovery?  When I listen to classical music of any kind, I can choreograph a ballet along with costumes, sets, and props to go along with the music that I see in color when I close my eyes . . . even if the music has never been used for ballet.

You can flip the book open to any page and pull out something worth reading aloud and for that alone, I'd take my hat off to the man.  But beneath the distracting beauty of the prose is a very familiar story.  A good man returned from a bad war in a small town with a dark side, in this case, Sicilian gangsters, including the worst of the worst, a one eyed knifeman.  Sound familiar?  It is.  Gatreaux is at his best when he's wrapped in descriptions of the little lumber town called Nimbus, but the characters who populate it are prone to portentuous talk and symbolic actions.  We have riffs on Greek myths, serpents in beds, man mountains engaged in knife fights in rivers, but I found little to persuade me from the thought that Gatreaux was bluffing with a weak hand.  Namely, that at the center of the novel, lie a pair of brothers that he doesn't seem to have a handle on.  The war veteran has apparently killed scores of men, so that he is accustomed to doling out death in close quarters, yet over 95% of men in World War One were killed through shelling or machine guns, both distant intervention.  It was this, the blindness of fate, that you couldn't see who you were killing, or who was killing you, that was responsible for much of the pressure described as shell shock.  Gatreaux's veteran comes across then as a mythic figure, but the author seems to want us to believe in the grit and truth of his town.  I found it ultimately impossible, when I couldn't believe in the grit and truth of his characters, leaving the book with a hollow beauty, disappointing despite the promise.\", 'overall': 3.0, 'summary': \"Writing can't disguise the weakness of the plot\", 'unixReviewTime': 1064880000, 'reviewTime': '09 30, 2003'}\n",

Ever human's IQ soars to 400 or something like that.This book suffers from the problem a lot of sci fi books have - the author isn't really able to conceive of what people that smart would think or do, or invent because - well - the author isn't that smart; so aside from characters being able to conceive of new differential equations on the fly (some people can already do that, I'd bet) and invent new languages there isn't much happening here.The funny part is everybody with a boring job (that is to say, everybody except the scientists) simply quit working so there is no food or anything to buy.

The action centers on Jim and Frank, young colonists on Mars, and Jim's 'pet', Willis.  Mars is run by the Company who supplies the colonists needs, including a boarding school for high school aged colonists and organizing the annual migration.  As Jim and Frank (and Willis) arrive at school they discover that not everyone working for the Company has the colonists best interests at heart.  The kind head master is replaced by an autocratic bully who promptly confiscates all guns and pets - including Willis.  While rescuing Willis the boys uncover a more serious plot and soon the three are fleeing across the planet to warn their families.This book is very much a precursor to STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND, the descriptions of the Martians, their culture, and abilities are very much the same.  The basic story is one of RAH's typical youngster(s) same their society with the help of friendly aliens, very much in the same vein as, PODKAYNE, HAVE SPACESUIT WILL TRAVEL, THE STAR BEAST etc.  As always with RAH's stories it is exciting, has more than a few interesting twists and will probably cause the reader to re-examine some long held beliefs.  It also has some more annoying RAH traits - the women are definitely there to feed the men and raise the children, the characters are all either completely good or completely bad.  RAH's familiar themes of 'arms make the citizen', 'big government is bad government', 'the aliens will save us' and 'women need to be protected by men' are also all there as well.This is a fun read, for both adults and children.

One ad I saw compared Goodman's handling of the story to Erik Larson and I agree.  There are pictures of the people and places and modes of transport to help the reader feel part of the exciting trip.  Complications abounded for both women as weather, miscommunications, and mechanical problems with ships and steamers conspired to slow them down.One funny part of Nelly Bly's story is that she was suddenly approached by several young men, one at a time, who seemed eager to marry her.  Rumor had it that she was an heiress who was traveling to mend a broken heart.  Her sudden suitors were looking for someone wealthy to support them, and at least one didn't mind saying so.  Finally she told one young man that it was all an act; actually she was quite poor and a friend had paid for her trip.  That was the end of the suitors.I won't ruin the story by telling you who won the race but even afterward the story of the two women and the rest of their life is fascinating.  In retrospect, I suppose I could have predicted their fate, but then again maybe not.Highly recommended readingSource:  Amazon Vine\", 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': 'Women Attempt to Outdo Phileas Fogg in 1890s', 'unixReviewTime': 1359676800, 'reviewTime': '02 1, 2013'}\n",

You very rarely see that in romances, and I really appreciate it. There\\'s no reason not to have a blind hero in a romance novel. I loved Vincent as a character. He seemed real to me...he was a man who had accepted his disability with dignity, yet, was still at odd times overwhelmed by panic attacks in relation to it. His emotions ran the gamut, and I liked that. I also liked Sophia...to a point. She just seemed a bit too one-dimensional to me. Her only \"flaw,\" if you could call it that, was that she was not necessarily beautiful. But, the author seemed to solve that with new clothes and a hair cut. Besides her Aunt, Uncle and cousin, everyone else loved her, even if they initially thought she was unattractive on first meeting her, that opinion changed rapidly, and they ended up loving her. Even the \"evil\" cousin she had that ruined her self-esteem came off as an idiot that really didn\\'t dislike her. She never had a bad word to say about anyone....she was just a bit too \"goody-goody\" for me. I need to see that she\\'s got some flaw, or she just doesn\\'t seem real.The story overall was good, and I did like the way that Sophia came up with all of these ideas to help Vincent out on his estate. But, again, Sophia has all the ideas. Everyone else seems to be clueless. Another way that the Sophia character is too perfect. All that perfectness made for a bland story. There was really no conflict at all. There was some potential conflict that could have happened between Sophia and Martin, Vincent\\'s valet. But it just seemed like Martin disliked Sophia, then went away from the story for awhile, then came back and loved Sophia like everyone else did. So much for conflict. I really need some kind of \"spice\" to my stories. This one really had none.

But for the most part, I enjoyed it. Of course, this isn't a story about the first blush of love or the first stirrings of passion. Laren and Alex have been married for about five years. They were wonderfully in love when they exchanged their vows, but the crushing loss of a baby three years ago drove a wedge between them that they have not been able to overcome.The book opens with the MacKinloch clan under attack. Their homes are burned to the ground and Laren is injured. Despite her wounds, she doesn't turn to her husband. And it's his fear of her death coupled with the realization of her distance that wakes Alex up to the serious chasm between them. He vows to fix things, but watching the two of them try to reconcile is frustrating and sad. Alex is the chief of the tribe and he expects Laren to be the lady of his people. But she is terribly shy and her childhood as a poor outcast makes her feel unable and unworthy to be what her husband wants her to be. Instead, she finds her solace in glassmaking. It's a skill she learned from an old priest after her son's death. She finds beauty and purpose in her art and she has done it for years in secret.Laren's glass can generate the money they clan needs to rebuild. But Alex feels betrayed that she has kept this secret all these years. The two of them clearly love each other. However, it's difficult to watch them blunder through their relationship. Alex lords over Laren the same way he rules the clan. He tries to bend her to his will. Though admittedly, his intentions are good, he does real damage to her spirit and makes her feel that he doesn't value her for who she is. At the same time, Laren is guilty of being a martyr. She hides her feelings and keeps her secrets by telling herself Alex doesn't need to be burdened by them. I wanted to just shake them both, especially during the first half of the book.Things do get better, though, as our couple begins to understand and accept each other. And watching them finally come together is quite lovely. There is deep loss and sadness in their relationship, but there is real love there, which makes their journey worth watching... especially once they begin to communicate.An external threat does hover over our couple, in the form of the clan's enemy... who is trying to crush the MacKinlochs once and for all. Also, we've got some strong secondary characters, like Alex's brothers, which give the book more depth. I'm really interested to read poor Callum's story --and I hope it comes next.Overall, I found that I did enjoy this, especially once our couple started actually talking to each other. 4 stars.*ARC Provided by NetGalley\", 'overall': 4.0, 'summary': 'Finding love again', 'unixReviewTime': 1310860800, 'reviewTime': '07 17, 2011'}\n"

I was interested to learn about his relationships with other illustrators and artists, his personality and family, and his own view of the art world and his place in it.  Although I grew up with Rockwell\\'s covers on the Saturday Evening Post that were delivered to my family\\'s home every week, before reading this book I knew little about him as a person.Solomon\\'s a good writer and the book is a quick, easy read.  She focuses more on the events of Rockwell\\'s life than on his art, although the art is not neglected.  She seems to be writing more for the general reader than the art academic.What I found strange was Solomon\\'s references to Rockwell\\'s sexual issues, not that he really had any, that we are told of, but she gives us little off-hand remarks about homoerotic issues, and say . . . was there a latent pedophile lurking inside Norman?  I could not figure out her purpose.  Did she feel she needed to juice the book up a bit - in many ways Rockwell was sort of boring, not your drunken womanizer type male artist who\\'s relatively easy to write about - was she trying to establish her own creds with the gender studies and queer theory crowd, or is she subconsciously driven by repressed gender identity issues of her own?  Interpret at your own risk (phrase borrowed from Solomon herself - below).As a illustration (yes) of Solomon\\'s bizarreness, after planting the homoerotic, homosexual and pedophile issues in your mind, she comes (yes, intentional, read on) to write about a mural Rockwell did for the Nassau Inn in Princeton, N.J., which included an image of Yankee Doodle.  The first line of the Yankee Doodle song was to be written on the mural.  Was it \"Yankee Doodle came to town,\" or Yankee Doodle went to town.\"  The \"debate\" was written up in the July 17, 1937, issue of The New Yorker magazine.In Solomon\\'s telling: \"Princeton\\'s board of trustees took a vote; it resulted in a tie.  Rockwell settled on the word \\'came\\'.  Interpret at your own risk.\"  \"Come\" on, Debbie.  Not only that, if one goes back, as I did, and reads the entire original piece in The New Yorker, it\\'s clear the word \"came\" was chosen, but it is not clear that it was Rockwell\\'s choice.  Go figure.My recommendation: read the book but forgive Solomon\\'s overly fertile mind and ignore the obvious absurdities.', 'overall': 4.0, 'summary': 'A good book, but a very strange one', 'unixReviewTime': 1392249600, 'reviewTime': '02 13, 2014'}\n",

In essay after essay, I found myself saying,\"Go on, Joan. You said it, Joan. We are the same, you and I, Joan, etc.\" That is the type of book Slouching Towards Bethlehem is. Reading it, slowly, meticulously, I felt such a close kinship, a bond, not with the writer but with her words -- so carefully chosen and wonderfully articulated. These essays are not meant, honestly, for teenagers, although, if given a chance, the totality of the book would be most beneficial for their pliable and socially indoctrinated minds.The purport of this book is something that I can so easily identify with: the disappearance of the past for the establishment of a fragmented, roughly organized new society with newfangled, unaccustomed societal perceptions as well as an aggressive casting off of the traditional value system of those who were born and raised a long time before the emergence of the radical, cataclysmic sixties. These essays explore, through author Joan Didion\\'s own feelings and experiences and the feelings and experiences of those she encountered, the disharmononized emotions of the hippy generation vs the elders of the more reactionary periods, periods where: Free Love, Acid Trips, Groovy, Crystal Snorting Gurus and Muumuu Dressed Followers seemed a complex and social oddity in the hierarchy of those who were deemed, \"Not with it, man.\"What is so nice about these essays is that they are not condescending; there were and are thousands upon thousands of citizens and non-citizens alike who had and have no clue whatsoever as to what the counter-culture represented (me, honestly, being one in that vast catagory). Joan Didion thrust herself into its epicenter, and with a keen eye took it all in, trying to understand. The darkness of the counter-culture I think is best represented in the title essay \"Slouching Towards Bethlehen\" on page 101:  \"Pretty little 16-year-old chick comes to the Haight to see what it\\'s all about & gets picked up by a 17-year-old street dealer who spends all day shooting her full of speed again & again, then feeds her 3,000 mikes & raffles off her temporarily unemployed body for the biggest Hight Street gangbang since the night before last. The politics and ethics of ecstasy...\"  That was the darkness of the counter-culture, but that is not representative of the entirety of it. Didion\\'s family can be traced back all the way to the Donner-Reed tragedy in which cannibalism was the well known result. Thus, California is liked to that sole dark act; it is forever historically and symbolically linked, California becoming tarnished and not the land of \"Golden opportunity.\" That is one way of looking at the counter-culture. Or it can be viewed in this fashion, in the essay: \"Rock of Ages\" about Alcatraz Island on page 208:\"I saw the shower room (in Alcatraz) with the soap still in the dishes. I picked up a yellowed program from an Easter service...and I struck a few notes on an upright piano with the ivory all rotted from the keys and I tried to imagine the prison as it had been, with the big lights playing over the windows all night long and the guards patrolling the gun galleries and the silverware clattering into a bag as it was checked in after meals, tried dutifully to summon up some distaste, some night terror of the doors locking and the boat pulling away. But the fact of it was that I liked it out there, a ruin devoid of human vanities, clean of human illusion, and empty place reclaimed by the weather where a woman plays an organ to stop the wind\\'s whining and an old man plays ball with a dog named Duke...\"Maybe that is what the hippy generation was trying to flee from: \"Human vanities. Human illusions.\"Slouching Towards Bethlehem is a book where the search for meaning is in of itself the comprehension of change.

And despite some of the negative reviews here (which almost dissauded me), I found this book one of Satrapi\\'s most magical, perfect creations.  It\\'s quite different than the autobiographical, child-like Persepolis I, though readers of Persepolis II and Embroideries will recognize the general tone and style.  That said, it\\'s a work that takes you by surprise with its directness, honesty, and sheer invention.The book follows the last eight days of Nasser Ali Khan\\'s life, as he decides to resign himself to death after his wife, in an argument, destroys his precious \"tar\"--an Iranian sitar-like instrument.  He is a master musician, renowned throughout the country, and the great love affair of his life (despite one thwarted human one) was with this reciprocating instrument.  Unable to find another tar to requite his passion, he loses all taste for life and its joys, and decides to stay in bed until Azrael, the Angel of Death, comes for his soul.  While waiting, we get a series of flashbacks and flashforwards as he--and others--recount the stories and anecdotes that frame his life.  Reading this book is like listening in on family stories around the dinner table, which by their very nature are fragmentary, interrputed, and from multiple points of view.Though a simple story, the manner of telling it is amazingly complex and mesmerizing.  Satrapi\\'s storytelling is at its most concise here, but so much is revealed about the very human passions that shape a life, and how blind we are even to the people we live with.

I am certainly glad I did.  This author has an amazing gift.  I enjoyed the book so much I found myself resenting any intrusion that would keep me from reading.  I adored the characters, both Christian and Maddy.  Maddy is a Quaker and although some may be troubled by the thee-thou language, I found it a charming affect of the heroine.  Her faith was such a large part of her life, yet she married a Duke in part to save him from the horror of a madhouse as he recovers from a stroke.  The desperation this man feels at being trapped in his own body as he struggles is palatable and frightening.  You don't have a heart at all if you are not irresistibly drawn in to the story.  The abuses in the madhouse can be disturbing but nevertheless in context with the story, they serve a purpose.  If you like all hearts and flowers brain candy type romance novels, this is not the book for you.  Yet, if you want a riveting story, unforgettable characters, and an intense hero that will steal your heart immediately, and a heroine that you wish you could embrace, Flowers from the Storm is the book for you.  Christian, although reared with all the haughty arrogance of a Duke, learns a gut wrenching humility as he copes with his affliction and his dependence on his Maddygirl slowly turns into an intense all consuming passion.

      " review: this is the sequel tored to black a novel, which i had not read  you do not need to have read the first book to understand this one, but reading moscow sting likely will spoil the events of red to black  for that matter, reading the plot summary of the second book probably spoils the first oneanna is a former kgb colonel who defected to marry the british spy she was assigned to monitor  her husband was killed by the kgb before the opening of the book and she is in hiding with her young son  the british, americans and russians all want her because they believe she is the only one who knows the identity of mikhail, who provided her late husband with russian intelligence  an american private intelligence company gets to her first and a significant portion of the book involves the process of working her to disclose his identity and contact him to make him an american intelligence assetthis book was ok for me but it did not have the suspenseful tension that makes for a truly compelling espionage novel  the author has filled it with a lot of information about the politics of the spy business  the use of private intelligence companies, the kgbs control of russian business enterprises, political horse trading between the countries  but he tells it to the reader in a way that makes it just so many facts  i am assuming he has done the research to make it accurate  another thing that made the book less exciting is that it felt fairly believable  the americans holding anna did not torture or drug her to get the information  they interviewed her  endlessly  and, with one exception, there are not gun battles or wild chase scenesbelievable action scenes that would be too tame for the typical blockbuster spy movie need something more to draw the reader in  an emotional tie to the character  this book has so many different characters and points of view that it is difficult to get emotionally involved with any of them  anna is the obvious center of the book but the author puts in too much extra stuff  a subplot involving an assassin named lars was an unnecessary distraction from the central story  and the connection with anna suffersfinally, some of the details make little sense in the context of the story  annas handler suggests she take a gun to a meeting where she will be otherwise unprotected  of all the handgun possibilities, she improbably requests a single shot pistol with a very long barrel to hide under her clothes  and unless this is covered in the earlier book, anna is much more familiar with new york city than she should befans of the espionage genre who like a lot of information in the story and do not need pageturning action should enjoy this book  for me, i wanted action or emotional connection to the characters and did not feel either one \n",

      " review: beth revis across the universe is the first book in an intriguing dystopian scifi trilogy  after spending two hundred fifty years cryogenically frozen on a spaceship bound for an uncharted planet, amy is shocked when she is awakened fifty years before her parents are scheduled to be unfrozen  at first, the prospect of not seeing her parents until she is nearly seventy seems like the worst of her problems  but in addition to the nightmare of being trapped on a claustrophobic ship and the horror of discovering that many of the ships inhabitants behave more like drones than humans, she soon learns that a killer is targeting the cryogenically frozen people and her parents may be among the next victims  from the largely homogeneous and eerily obedient crew members to the ships dictatorial leader, amy finds herself very short on allies  thankfully, the young man who is next in line to lead the ship is intrigued by amy, and he may be exactly the ally she needs to keep her parents alive and to figure out how the ships population has gone in such a disturbing direction in the two hundred fifty years since it left earth  but elder grew up on the ship, and what seems horrifying to amy has always been described as normal and necessary to him  together they must unravel the truth and stop the killing before it is too latewhat i liked  this book is set on isolated ship hundreds of years away from earth and some of its inhabitants have made difficult and troubling decisions regarding resource management, diversity, and personal freedom  i was impressed by how disturbing and claustrophobic the atmosphere on the ship feels  half the chapters are from amys point of view and half are from elders point of view, which helped keep the tension high from start to finish  this book is essentially a dystopian novel set aboard a spaceship, so being introduced to the world from two different perspectives, that of a character who is an outsider and that of a character who has only ever known life aboard the ship, really helps set the stage for the story  elders friend harley, an artist who is considered an oddity because of his creativity, is one of the most compelling characters in the book  elements of his situation reminded me of one flew over the cuckoos nest, and his outlook as the story progressed brought to mind some interesting questions about what life could have been like if things had progressed differently on godspeed  my favorite scifi novels as well as my favorite dystopian novels tackle ethical and political issues that are relevant right here on presentday earth  if the setting is well conceived and the story is compelling, great scifi and dystopian novels can encourage us to examine hotbutton issues like genetic engineering and reproductive rights a bit more thoroughly  i liked that across the universe did not shy away from pushing some of those concepts to disturbingly plausible extremes  there are some very unlikeable individuals on godspeed, but some of their motivations held shades of gray, and i like villains who are painted in shades of gray  they are much more frightening and believable  there is plenty left to be explored in the next two books and the story is wide open for a million different possibilities, but this first book is also surprisingly conclusive  i look forward to seeing where the rest of the trilogy will gowhat i liked less  one of the primary mysteries in this story, the identity of the person unplugging the cryogenically frozen individuals, is too easy to deduce  thankfully, that is not the only twist in the story, so there are other surprises and deceptions to keep readers on their toes  while i liked that elder and amys story is not of the whirlwindromance variety, i was hoping to feel more chemistry between them  i respected and pitied them both, but i did not really care whether their relationship ventured beyond friendship  perhaps the second book will change my mind about that  i found the plot and setting a bit more compelling than the protagonists  amy and elder both have to deal with some sad and traumatizing situations in this book, but i was more wrapped up in the plot than the characters, so i never found myself in tearsi would recommend across the universe to fans of scifi and dystopian novels  the story moves along at a fast clip, with short chapters and quite a bit of lifeanddeath drama, so it may also be a good pick for reluctant readers i look forward to reading the second book, a million suns \n",

      " review: first the analytical franzen has a terrific turn of phrase, marvelous vocabulary, but remains very readable  he builds suspense in the smallest spaces of the human mind, and yet sees the importance of the big picture, and leaves gorgeous clues as to where his characters will find themselves, or where they see themselves  like pynchon and wallace, he treads the sometimes surreal area between the landscape and the land, and lets the reader often decide which, but he does not venture so far into his own mind that you forget which story he is telling  his structure is brilliant, reminiscent of vintage faulkner in his timeline, but honestly his ability to tie events together throughout his characters histories, and present the results of past actions as beautiful surprises in the prose reminded me more of thomas hardy  readers unfamiliar with literature might need to keep a dictionary handy, but i always enjoy that aspect of prodigious novels  however, franzen is here to tell a well constructed story, not convince us that he is read the oed, which cannot be said for some writers of equal stature  loving your family and friends despite their faults is what living life is all about, and someone able to attain that goal in a novel is a writer of literature, not storybooks or badly disguised scripts for lifetime original moviesthose who stopped reading this book half way through completely missed its point  everyone has quirks and dysfunctions, and franzens laser beam eye for them does make the reader squirm, but squirm deliciously, at their own foibles and those of their own family members, and laugh at the same foibles it is hard to find tragedy that is so damn funny  but a dysfunctional family is simply the macguffin here  this book is not about solving problems among family members none of them get solved but about the hope that lies beneath all hardship, the humanity behind the dysfunctionreaders who do not like these characters may be lying to themselves about their own idiosyncracies  although i identified a lot with chip there is something in each of these characters that holds a mirror to the reader  what franzen possesses in great abundance is a love of people, a love of humanity that transcends the darker side of human behavior  without that love of humanity, there is no way he could have written this book  when you reach the end, its ultimate message is hope, after all, true hope that it is never too late to be happy in life  what better message can a book bring forth than that \n",

      " review: except for classical or historical novels, i admit that i am not much of a fiction reader i picked this book up only because norman mailer wrote it and because he is understood to be one of americas foremost writers of fiction i had read a book by him about lee harvey oswald and was so unimpressed that i have now forgotten its title it was supposed to be nonfiction, but appeared to me to be anything butanyway, this book was my attempt to give mailer another chance it is of course about the brief period of freedom and then the ignominious death by firing squad of one, gary mark gilmore charitably, gilmore can at best be described as the scum of the earth, having spent most of his life in, rather than out of prison, from crimes as petty as liquor store heists, up to murderwhatever literary value this book is supposed to have had, in my mind at least, was lost and overshadowed by the wanton, random, and utter senselessness and brutality of the murders he committed before he was finally recaptured and executedthis, his last chance at freedom, was squandered like the rest of his life gilmore proved that he was not able to handle life on the outside because he had no idea how to go about it unlike his structured life inside, his life outside of prison had no rhyme or reason what he knew how to do was to create chaos wherever he wentduring his freedom, he was like the ball in a pinball machine, randomly bouncing along a downward obstacle course of life, where he hoped to be able to ring a few bells, hit a few bright lights and make a few noises before the lights were finally turned out on him for good it seems that the script for the ending of his life had already been written by him at birth his life was an existential black hole, without hopesomehow, mailer tried to turn this foreordained tragedy into a love story between gilmore and a trailer park loser named nicole, but in my view it all was mostly a literary contrivance this was not a story of hope from the beginning, we knew there would be only a fiery ending to this saga all that was left to do was to tie up the loose endsthe die sending gilmores life on its inexorable downward trajectory had already been cast instead of mark, tragedy should have been gilmores middle name everything he touched turned to death and then to dust he was, always the walking dead a zombie brought back to life by mailers literary trickseven when he emerged from prison, all of his lifelines, as well as his nine lives, had been used up he stood facetoface with the existential precipice it was overthecliff for him, and the sooner the better did anyone really think that gary mark gilmore was going to live out the rest of his lost freedom and life as a gas station attendant better to go out in a blaze of ignominious glory which is what he did hell, even i could write that storythe only tension left for the artist to resolve was how many innocent souls would become the victim of this human wrecking ball if it takes skill to resolve that dilemma, then leave me out all i can see is the pain of those who died at his senseless hands if there is art here i am glad i missed itone star \n",

      " review: the twelfth century spanish poet yehuda halevi was wellrespected during his lifetime, but is better known today for his poetical defense of judaism called the kuzari, a book that is admired by so many jews that numerous rabbis give classes and lectures on it, as if it is a holy book unfortunately, neither these rabbis nor their congregants delve deeply enough into the volume to understand it, as halkin doeshillel halkin, an expert on hebrew literature, is an excellent choice to write about halevi halkin states that very little is known about halevis personal life, including when he was born and died, who he married and about his children the noun halevi was not his name it was applied to all jews who are levites, putative descendant of jacobs son levi, and means the levite virtually all that is known about him is drawn from brief often somewhat obscure personal references contained in his poems and some letters, including letters found in 1896 in the cairo genizah in egypt we know that he was not only a successful poet, but also a physician with a medical practice but he wrote that he did not like being a doctor and felt that he was not good at ithalkin spends most of his book discussing halevis poetry he gives many examples of halevis nonreligious poems on wine, women, and song such as, o swear by love that you remember days of embraces  as i remember nights crammed with your kisses, his religious poems, and his poems about israel, including his famous poem, whose opening words halkin translates as, my heart in the east, but the rest of me far in the west the wellknown line of the famous israeli song of the 1967 war jerusalem of gold, of copper, and of light,  to all your songs i am a lute was taken from halevis zion do you wonder halkin analyses many of the poems and shows how they are constructed readers will learn much about poetry from these discussionshalkin also writes about spain during halevis lifetime, and this will interest people who want to know about this unusual, often turbulent period of jewish history, the time and place when and where judaisms greatest philosopher moses maimonides 11381204 was bornbut, halevis presentday renown is based on his kuzari, a fictional account of a rabbi explaining judaism to a nonjewish kuzar king halevi subtitled his kuzari the book of proof and demonstration in defense of the despised faith like his negative opinion about his medical practice, halevi repudiated his kuzari in a letter as foolishness halkin suggests that halevi may have been referring to an early version of this classic, but this is by no means certain because many of the ideas that halevi offers his readers are difficult if not impossible to accepthalevi argues in a circular fashion, for example, that judaism is not based on faith but on historical experience we know, he insists, that there were six hundred thousand israelites at sinai because the bible tells us so  and we know that the bible is telling us the truth because six hundred thousand israelites could not have been wrong halkin comments, was not halevi aware, one wonders, of the faultiness of such logic how could it have failed to occur to him that the biblical account of sinaimight have been written long after the supposed events took place and been imagined, not by a multitude of israelites, but by a small number of biblical authorshalevi proves that free will exists by arguing that we know it exists because we feel that it exists halkin states that this approach is disappointingly navebut his most radical and outrageous notion, an idea never previously presented by anyone, is that jews are biologically superior to nonjews nonjews, he insists, are incapable of fully developing spiritually, even converts to judaism cannot develop because their biology remains unchanged thus, no nonjew can become a prophethalevi took an extremely conservative approach to the divine commandments whereas moses maimonides, for example, explained that all of the torahs commands are rational, halevi insisted that humans are incapable of understanding the divine commandments and they must be obeyed simply because god said sothe kuzari contains curious discrepancies, for example, halevi rails against philosophy as being harmful to judaism, yet he goes to great length to attempt to prove that an ancient jewish book that he respected sefer hayetsirah is a philosophical book halkin suggests that halevi extolled philosophy in an early version of the kuzari, changed his mind, and forgot to edit this part of his volumeprobably the only redeeming factor in the kuzari is halevis argument that jews should stop waiting for god to restore israel to the jewish people jews should take matters into their own handsharkin compares halevis kuzari to maimonides rational guide of the perplexed the reader attracted to maimonides will find the kuzari irrational in its assumptions, careless in its logic, dismissive of scientific thinking, presumptuously ethnocentricin short, this is an excellent presentation of halevis poetry and his radical ideas about judaism \n",

      " review: a received a review copy of this book courtesy of the publisher via netgalley in exchange for my honest opinionlet me start by saying that i probably would not have picked this book up had netgalley not invited me to read it, however it was very readable, compulsively sowhile the last book i read by this author duo, between you  me, was very reminiscent of the life of britney spears, the first affair made me think about the bill clinton and monica lewinsky affair while i was only in my early teens when the news of the clintonlewinsky affair broke, it is obviously a highly publicized case so of course i was familiar with many aspects of the caseenough to see too many similarities to jamie mcalister and president gregory rutland in this fictitious accountobviously the clintonlewinsky affair is a huge moment in not only us history but world history, and in years to come i am sure it will still be spoken about, and i am also fully aware that many authors get inspiration from real world events, but and it is a big buti think a different spin could have been put on it rather than the first affair being almost a carbon copy of lewinskygatethe saving grace for me was reading about jamies difficult childhood, living with an alcoholic father and living in the shadows of an older sister erica who inherited the same addictive personality growing up in a volatile middleclass environment, jamie seems to have craved attention from older male figures  apparent when we are introduced to a character from her past  to make up for the love and affection her father was unable to offer this background offered an insight into how and why a person such as jamie could be so naive and needy of attention it is just an unfortunate series of events that led her to a huge mistakeafter reading between you  me, i just felt that this followed the same formula in that the main characters and events are based on extremely familiar real life people and events also at times it felt as though the two different writing styles of the authors was quite obvious and this interrupted the flow for me it was hard for me to only rate the first affair 3 out of 5 as i really do like the authors, and overall i did enjoy the book but there were just too many flaws for me to group it with some of the other books i rated 4 out of 5 so far this year i would still recommend this book to other readers, especially those looking for an easy summer read \n",

      " review: ben h winters, ltstrongbedbugsltstrong quirk books, 2011full disclosure this book was provided to me free of charge by amazon vineokay, a topical read this will be dated in five years horror novel from a guy listed as a new york times bestseller i bit without doing my research, which ended up being annoying i had my suspicions when i saw quirk as the publisher, and then the author description confirmed my worst fears ben h winters is the new york times bestselling author of ltemsense and sensibility and sea monstersltem lord save us from this current classic novelmonster movie mashup fad, which is getting more idiotic every month but still, i loved the jacket copy on this, which made it sound like a weird mix of ltemrosemarys babyltem and ltemthe sentinelltem, two of my favorite cheesy horror novels, so i dove in and while no one will ever confuse ben winters with jeffrey konvitz, ltembedbugsltem delivers nicelyi do not know ben winters, nor do i know anything about his life, but i am going to take a few guesses he is about my age early forties, maybe a few years younger, and he grew up on a steady diet of crappy horror novels during the golden age of the seventies and eighties i say this because ltembedbugsltem, while definitely a contemporary book and as influenced by bret easton ellis as by anything golden ageplease, authors, i beg you, quit with the product placement, is very much informed not only by levin and konvitz, but by any number of others the true craphorror buff will recognize from back in the dayhelen mccloy, rick hautala, ken eulo, i think i may have even caught a slight whiff of early joy fielding, who was writing pulp horror novels before she made it big in the thriller world specifically, i am thinking of ltemthe transformationltem, which if you are a fielding fan and you have not read, you should be spending every available moment trying to hunt down and i grant you, authors that blend up old influences and regurgitate them onto the page are a dime a dozen, but as i said back in paragraph one, there is no point in this book at which winters would be mistaken for any of them he is pulled out all the old horror tropes and dragged them kicking and screaming into the twentyfirst century, and it is about bloody time someone didplot exlawyer susan wendt, who left behind her stressful, highpaying corporate job to return to her art, is looking for a new apartment she has a husband and a daughter, but they are more important as plot points than as characters this is the books weakest aspect the minor characters are there for the sole purpose of advancing susan, louis the handyman, and andrea the landlord on the narrative path she finds the oldest horror trope in the book a gorgeous twofloor space in red hook, which, okay, is losing property values by the minute right now but is still in brooklyn fergossake, for a steal turns out it is the top two floors of a converted house owned by andrea, a slightly crazy old lady whose husband shuffled off this mortal coil a few years before andrea has a pal named louis who does the handiwork he is less crazy than andrea, but still a little cocked, if you get my drift in any case, susan falls in love with the place, immediately latches onto andrea as a mother figure, and within days her family has moved into the place all well and good, except that the current bedbug craze has swept through brooklyn like wildfire everyones talking about bedbugs it is enough to make a person think they have bites when the best exterminator in town tells you you do not have them and your husband and kid have no bites it is even enough to make you think that maybe the bugs are supernatural in origin, and they are specifically targeting youi have to admit, the first hundredish pages of this book had me wanting to pound my head against the wall i have already mentioned the annoying productplacement stuff, though in a book this topical that is less of a problem once people stop obsessing over bedbugs, this book is probably headed for the remainder outlets of bookstore chains, so one does not have to worry as much about the brand names one uses suddenly no longer existing if someone picks up the novel thirty years later a major problem for younger readers of stephen king novels these days, one thinks and it is slow, slow, slow winters does not really start ramping up the tension until the family gets into the new place, and even then, he keeps it lowkey until susans obsessions start getting her into the supernaturalcrazy realm, at which point winters shakes off the fetters, kicks out the jams, and sends this book into fullon seventiescraphorror mode at which point it becomes a real treat if you remember the subgenre, or if you are younger and have discovered it after the fact hard to do considering how much of it is out of print these days, but there are great old used bookstores that can feed your habit for years you may have to drive twelve hours to find one, but it is worth it once you have fit the book into that framework, it all makes sensei also have to give winters points for not going completely off the rails with the ending obviously i cannot really discuss what happens without major spoilers, but i am not talking about the events so much as i am the atmosphere in todays horror culture, this book would probably have been an easier sell if winters went with an eli rothesque ending buckets of fake blood, etc instead of sticking with the seventies horror formula but he did, and at least to me, that made a huge difference in how i saw the book as a whole winters obviously has a great affection for, and loyalty to, pulp horror, and in turn, that gave me a greater affection for, and loyalty to, ltembedbugsltem i hope this book is not nearly as verticalmarket as i think it is, and i hope even more that it grows a passion for those outofprint pulp classics in a whole new generation of readers

out a couple of years ago that i recently reviewed doubt is their product  the basis, first used by the tobacco industry many years ago, was that their goal was to manufacture doubt in the minds of the public and policymakers so that no policymaking action would occur, or at least so that it should be delayed as long as possible  and the tobacco industry succeeded for decades after they themselves knew that tobacconicotine was addictive and caused cancer  yet they carried on a wellfunded campaign to confuse and disinform the publicnaomi oreskes and erik conway are science historians  and what they have uncovered with this book should shock even those who are familiar with some of the tactics used by the professional denialist industry  what is even more shocking is how just a handful of scientists and their collaborators have had a hand in nearly every major science denial episode for the last 40 years  and in the center of it all is the george c marshall institute, fred seitz, s fred singer, and the lesser known but equally deceptive william nierenberg and robert jastrowafter the tactics were perfected in the fight to deny that smoking causes cancer, these handful of men with close ties to the reagan and conservative ideologies employed them over and over again to deny smokestack emissions cause acid rain, cfcs cause ozone depletion, second hand smoke cause cancer in nonsmokers, and greenhouse gas emissions cause global warming  in all cases the science has been right, and this group of men helped delay action for many years until even their deceit could not hide the truthand those tactics, repeated to deny the science in each of these issues, were all the same employ a few scientists willing to shill for the industry or who are skeptical to create the illusion of credibility, focus the efforts through wellfunded right wing think tanks to create the illusion of independence, create new science specifically designed to create uncertainty ie, not to answer questions, but to create contrasting data they can misrepresent, hyperventilate about how the science is not settled knowing that science is never settled, but the public will not understand, and of course, using their pr skills, frank luntz wordsmithing, and punchy  though meaningless  catchphrases like sound science to make it sound like they are saying something when they are not saying anythingwhat i found amazing was how the origins of the george c marshall institute and all of its subsequent science denialism came out of the cold war fight against communism  these handful of scientists were atomic bomb builders and astrophysicists who had no expertise in any of the science they were denying  but they had connections, most notably with the reagan administration and the strategic defense initiative star wars for which the george c marshall institute was started to sell to the public, the military, and the conservative legislators they were trying to influence  yet despite this lack of any expertise they continued to insert themselves into the acid rain debate, the cfc debate, the second hand smoke debate, and the climate change debate  and each and every time their goal was to push the denial of the science  they equated environmentalism with communism green on the outside, red on the inside  and using their lobbying skills and influence they were able to create the impression that there was still a raging debate in the science, even though in all cases the science was overwhelming and they represented a very minority opinion  actually, in all cases they were not being scientists at all, but rather advocates for nonaction all of these men had longsince stopped doing actual research, and none of them had ever done research in the areas of science they were denyingwhat is most disturbing is that they routinely employed unscientific methods and deceit to push their political views  these handful of men have almost singlehandedly cost the lives of thousands of americans and increased the cost to taxpayers millions or even billions of dollars through their denial of the science  most egregious in this has been s fred singer  first as a denier that smoking caused cancer, then as a denier that cfcs caused ozone depletion, and now as a denier of climate change, singer has used despicable methods to deceive fellow scientists who were too slow to realize that such deceit was possible from one of their own  what he did to roger revelle on his death bed is disgraceful  what he did to justin lancaster is despicable  what he and others did to ben santer is just one more example showing that the denialist industry, led by these few men and paid for by the biggest industries on the planet, will go to no end to deny any science or destroy any scientist in their path  the recent attacks on climate scientists like michael mann and phil jones are the latest iterations in the denialist industrys tacticsand according to oreskes and conway, the denialist industry is not even satisfied denying the present and the future, they have also recently turned to denying the past  you may have heard parroted from people here that the banning of ddt by environmentalists has killed millions of people in africa  not true  but the denialist industry has decided it needs to deny all science, and that means going back to the 1960s to attack rachel carson, whose book silent spring documented the dangers of widespread pesticide spraying  ddt was banned in the us after it was discovered that it caused the thinning of eggshells in raptors like our national symbol, the bald eagle  but like all the other denialist attacks, the idea that the us ban cost lives in africa is completely false  ddt use actually increased in africa after it was banned in the us, and in fact is still used today  it just does not work any more because the mosquitoes it is supposed to kill gained resistance to it, in part because of the overspraying advocated by the manufacturers to sell more product  but this is just one more case where facts are tossed aside in favor of an ideological promotion of an antiscience agenda designed to further the profit of the few at the expense of the manyoreskes and conway end their book with a new view of science, which i will let people read for themselves  and they should  in fact, they must  this book must be on the reading list of anyone and everyone interested in science, so they can read for themselves how just a handful of unscrupulous scientists with deep political connections and a near religious anticommunism fervor have been at the heart of every denial of science in the last several decades  as i indicated to open this review, the book made me angry  and we should be angry  and then we should not let them get away with it any longer \n",

      " review: if you have spent time and effort online and in the nikon manuals you already know that they explain how the settings work but not why  as we all shoot different subjects and have preferences and requirements as to metering modes on different shoots, there are a lot of questions as to which is the best setting for each situation  i use photoshop in postproduction my settings will be different than yours if you do not use a powerful post software, my settings will be different than yours  i shoot fastmoving subjects my settings will be different than yours if you shoot only landscapes i basically shoot a nikon d3x and d3 but help my brother with his d300  these are powerful tools you do not want to randomly messaround with when you determine your best settings  at some point, out of curiosity, i wasted two weeks playing around with possibilities on my three, awesome, factory defaultset cameras, only to be a bit confused in the end  i even found a reviewer online named ken x who is suggestions are outlandish  most photographers do not even know what their own settings are, leaving everything at default that nikon has installed into this powerful equipment  as such, you will get wonderful shots left as is, but you will miss so much of the potential you hold in your hands  this book is unbelievably simple and precise to understand, with not only what the settings do, but why, and what is suggested for each metering method, and when  i recommended getting into the habit of referring to the manual on my website, which is better than nothing, but ultimately the information in the manual leaves a lot of guesswork on your part, more so if you are not familiar with digital cameraphotography lingo, but i am going to change that recommendation to read the magic lantern books by photographer simon stafford  you will not learn this information in the field or in school  my circle of friends include many famous working and retired cinematographers who are still stuck on film because they do not understand digital or want to until they see it in action  even they need to rethink how digital works compared to their film knowledge  finally, not everyone has the years of working in photoshop that others  may have this is a big drawback as all shooting needs post production  the lab has always been paramount in the final outcome of a shoot the dark room is still as important today as it ever was, but now it is in the camera settings and in software such as photoshop  i am sharing a treasure of information with you in this review if you are really into digital photography  if you have ever remarked, how do they get those incredible shots, then you need to consider how important it might be to start with your camera  without knowing how to set it, you have settled for a mediocre  asset to your talent as an artist \n",

      " review: if you think the horror spoof comedy genre started with scary movie and shriek if you know what i did last friday the thirteenth, think again  horror was all the rage in the early 1980s as the introduction to this film points out, all 26 horror movies released during the previous year made a profit, so it comes as no surprise that some filmmaker would come along and try to exploit the genre for laughs and money  and so was born student bodies  i know what you are thinking when you see the title  naked girls  but i am going to have to disappoint you on that score  even though the film received an r rating, there is almost nothing rrated about it  no actual nudity, very little profanity, and only the slightest amount of blood  sure, kids keep getting killed for having sex, but none of them actually live long enough to do it  and the killer uses whatever he can find, so forget about machetes and knives and think eggplant, erasers, and paper clipsa distinctly halloweenesque opening scene introduces us to the breather  actually, you could say the breather introduces himself to us because, even though the camera shows us each scene from his perspective, he maintains a fairly constant monologue around all of his heavy breathing  in this fashion, he gives us a number of the films funniest lines, such as when he is struggling to climb stairs, stepping in chewing gum, questioning his choice of footwear, or calling in to announce when and where he is going to kill next using  a rubber chicken to disguise his voice  we do not know who the killer really is until the end, of course, but there is no shortage of suspects at the local high school  do not expect any yellow tape to appear around crime scenes, by the way, because the school conducts its own investigation  principal peters joe talarowski is not going to let the murder of several students ruin the biggest school day of the year due to budget cuts, the school has to have all extracurricular activities such as the big game, the big parade, the prom, etc on the same day, and todays the day  not even when a second couple are murdered at the big funeral of the first dead couple  instead of cops, principal peters calls on a few teachers and a schizophrenic psychologist to name the killer  meanwhile, dogooder toby kristen riter, who has the bad habit of discovering most of the victims, conducts a secret investigation of her own  who could the murderer be  principal peters  the horse head bookendsobsessed and constantly scenestealing shop teacher mr dumpkin joe flood  the seriously addled contortionist of a janitor  the girl who would do anything to make sure she gets elected prom queen  weirdoes abound on this campus, so just about anyone could be the breatheri should point out the fact that you do not have to be a horror fan to enjoy student bodies  you might not recognize the references to films such as halloween, when a stranger calls, or carrie, but that will not stop you from appreciating all of the comedy on display here  do not let the fact that producer michael ritchie went the allen smithee route in the credits worry you, either  this movie is almost bursting at the seams with great oneliners  not only is student bodies a genuinely funny movie, it actually manages to stay consistently funny from start to finish  and all without resorting to the exceedingly raunchy level of similar films today  it is possible that a few viewers might be offended by a few things here and there such as the manner in which a blind student and a crippled student are portrayed, but i would be lying if i said these were not some of the movies funniest moments  if you have a sense of humor and do not adopt an elitist attitude toward dumb jokes, i am willing to bet you will find much more satisfaction in student bodies than all of the films in the scary movie franchise combined  in this case, the first truly is the best \n",

      " review: this cd is one of my most favorite titles in my entire 10,000 cd library  i have over 40 official zappa albums and have been listening to and collecting zappa records ever since i was 14 in 1967 so i believe i am qualified to judge this album  for those who do not know, the first part of this cd is the only existing release of the original mix of the original vinyl album, the man from utopia  that album was released by itself in a drastically altered version by ryko circa 1992, a horribly modified and outofpropersequence mix that was perpetuated by the zappa family trust in their 2012 release  this review is not about those cds which do not deserve a moment more of my or your time  also, the second album on this cd is not being reviewed here either because it is the same as the independently released version, so just refer to reviews of that album and apply those comments to the second part of this album ship arriving  this review is solely for this title which is a 2fer 2 albums on 1 cd which was released only in france and england  now that we have got the small print out of the way, my first comment is about the quality of the sound recording  frank was always ahead of his time especially in the studio and though i was not there, i am sure these tracks were recorded on an early digital recorder, perhaps the very first dat  that is how clean, crisp, and clear the album sounds  simply said, the audio quality is the highest i have ever heard  now, about the music on this album  first thing to know is that this album is a mix of studio tracks and live recordings but the live tracks do not suffer the audio distractions and noises heard on typical live recordings  they are so clean, the sounds from the audience seem like they were written into the songs and orchestrated by frank himself  those halfspoken, halfsung tracks the dangerous kitchen, the radio is broken, and the jazz discharge party hats are accompanied by franks guitar playing and band improv, and are unique to this album, so they are a lot of fun to hear since you have never heard anything like this from frank before  those tracks were the basis of much of the negative comments others have made about this album but i say the reverse is true, that they enhance the album, not detract from it  the clear standout vocal track is the albums opener, cocaine decisions again, presented in its original form as it appeared on the vinyl album, but sex and stick together are a pair of songs thatll make you glad you bought those 15 woofers  my most favorite song is the instrumental we are not alone, an epic onslaught powerhouse of music easily capable of raising the hairs on the back of your neck when cranked up loud  you will never hear another song that combines a tenor sax with a xylophone to accomplish that  the song is one of the greatest album enders of all time  although i have read this pre1992 cd issue is slightly remixed, i have not been able to hear it and i do have both this cd and the vinyl lp  suffice it to say that if it is true, it is inconsequential  the important thing to know is to avoid every cd release of the man from utopia except this one, on this 2fer  this cd is an essential acquisition as it is the sole cd issue of the original 1983 vinyl record  all post1992 issues are extensively remixed in an altered sequence, but do feature a bonus track luigi  the wise guys which makes that album necessary for completists  happy plooking \n",

      " review: this budgetpriced collection from on the suddenly prolific pazzazz label samples 14 musicians known mostly for their urban blues as african americans and others moved north in the pre wwii years and later, they transformed the rural sound brought up from the deep south and texas  the tensions of the industrial north, according to the traditional history of this period, contributed to the themes and sounds of the chicago style the city where it predominated of course, the electric guitar, the demands of audiences and larger venues for louder music, and progenitors like muddy waters and howlin wolf may also have had something to do with the raw and raucous sound  early rockers, especially the british eg, the yardbirds and the stones took much of their material and style from  this  scene  the cd begins with two muddy waters tracks from 1950 and 1951 that show some differences from his comeback performances several decades later his voice is suppler and slightly higher  however, the trademark stinging guitar on the opening track rollin stone is unmistakable, as are the repetitive phrases eg, oh wells, the repeating rhythm recalling john lee hooker, the high bent notes and slurs, the combination of vibrato and buzzing sounds, and the deep authoritative voice  if anyone epitomizes the chicago sound, it would probably be this man  the title of this review is from one of his songs, available on the fathers and sons cd i saw him in concert in the late 1970s he retained all his power and his majesty one felt as if the entire history of the blues climbed on stage with himlittle walter may be somewhat overlooked in the pantheon of harp players, but  juke completely rocks, and he gets a powerful and pure sound sad hours is almost the opposite, a quiet, slow ballad with background harp, that accompanies a boring melody still, walter get a deepamped throaty sound that roars although it is not nearly as compelling if not as compelling as the earlier song the great howlin wolf has one of the most distinctive instantly recognizable voices in music  his voice think wolfman jack, the dj who copied wolfs gravelly pinched sound has great dynamics and emotion he is somewhat of an acquired taste, but he and muddy are the two greats of the early chicago scene the songs are somewhat more melodic than muddys with less reliance on the guitar, and more on the rhythm and attaining a raw voice through the vocals and instrumentals  moanin at midnight is justifiably one of his most famous numbers he is truly the wolfman here, almost scary in his extended moans, and his transition of his voice to an intensely concentrated sound  the guitars are equally intense and buzzy, and the entire theme is shaded with fright and mystery  screaming jay hawkins may have been listening it is a tour de force, turn it up loud and scare the neighborsthere is an abrupt transition after wolfs intensity to memphis minnie  her apparently untrained vocal sound, deep and slightly unpretty, is the highpoint of an otherwise banal chugchugchug rhythm section  at the break, there is a nice solo interplay between the harp and guitar, although too brief, it is contains the most instrumental energy in the song  robert nighthawk does sweet black angel, 1949 a song covered by many groups under the title sweet little angel nighthawk has a slow delivery, and the purposeful notes of the slide guitar are excellent  there is a muddylike slide in the solo and nighthawk turns in an exciting ballad a sometimes problematic form for the typically loud, fast chicago stylejimmy rogers has two numbers on the compilation he is more of a crooner if there is such a thing in chicago blues, with soul shadings reminiscent of sam cooke  he is got one of the prettiest voices here, high and smooth, and he sings with such feeling that he effectively draws your attention to the lyrics  rogers is the stand out here, and his voice is a revelation of the variety of blues vocal styles  on five long years, his voice is more plaintive, the harmonica little walter is loud and potent, and the sound is less melodic and more intense there is excellent harp and guitar, and a good balance of the instruments  rogers again shows his originality in his highnoted second syllables  eddie boyd begins five long years  1952 in a big band style think count basie and jimmy rushing and he sings a more jazzinflected sound, betrayed occasionally by his southern accent  the relative predominance of horns also marks this as somewhat atypical  unfortunately, it is not as well recorded as some of the other songs here his second number registers more clearly, and the accompanying  sax and drums are clearly jazz oriented boyds songs lack some excitement, but are historically interesting because of the crossoverdisc 2 begins with the countryinfused sounds of jimmy reed, complete with some honky background piano, and  high notes on the harp it is a rambling sound, with palpable roots in  rural blues  on the second cut bright lights, big city, 1961 his voice sounds more nasal, and there is a backing female voice and chorusthe song seems designed for airplay  fans of the yardbirds will instantly recognize billy boy arnolds  own i wish you would 1955, the prominent low drums, pace, and harp riff are the same as the british groups remake in the 1960s  arnold has a  nice throwaway vocal style that does not overpower you at the break, the harp slows and softens , then  returns for some wails accompanied  by that great incessant drumming  this is one of the best cuts on the album then i was fooled is also interesting  there is a somewhat tiresome story about a guy and his chicks,  but the vocal is intimate and teasing  there is an interesting bass line and some organ  at the break, there is a great harp solo, augmented by crashing drums and ringing guitar i do not know if anybodys remade this, but the song is ripe for redoingafter fooled, lillian ott almost responds to arnolds song with will my man be home tonight 1960 the instrumental are good if not very original, and there is some gimmicky crying  do not cry, mamago to bed  memphis slim sings we gonna rockwe gonna roll on rockin the house, a number that sounds like early rock rather than the chicago blues, complete with yackety sax the much slower wish me well also from 1959 and memphis reds 1953 please mr doctor has a similar  feeling, although the guitar sounds much more authentic  j b hutto keep a rural edge to the songs, adding vintage instrumentation combination boogie from 1954  features a washboard, maybe a triangle, rough, more authentic sounding sounds, and  a more intense vocal style that recalls howlin wolf  it is a refreshing change from the swerve towards rock in the previous songs hutto shows his versatility by changing to a muddy waterslike vocal and instrumentation on things are so slow  the cd closes with two famous songs performed by elmore james the 1957 it hurts me too later done by the stones, and james own 1953 dust my broom  james voice sounds modern or maybe it is just the good recording, like rogers, he commands your attention  the backing guitar and slide solos on it hurts me too are good but not all that powerful overall, the renowned dust my broom has more energythis is an excellent sampling of some of the most famous musicians on the chicago scene, along with some not as well known today  there is a very good variety of styles, belying the ridiculous clicheacute that chicago blues sound too much alike while the recording quality varies from good to fair, no remastering was done, and the dates range from  1941  to 1961 with most in the 50s  i recommend this as a budget sampler of varied musicians for those familiar with the chicago blues, and as an introduction for novices hopefully, the latter will pick up some of the betterrecorded albums featuring only a favorite musician or two, either from this same period, or from the blues renaissance of the 70s and 80s  i am dinging this a bit partly for sound quality, and mostly because the liner notes are pitifully lacking there is a very, very brief discussion of the blues, and the track information contains the year of the recording, the writer, and the publisher only personnel are not listed \n",

      " review: in which they have revitalized yet another milestone in composer jerry goldsmiths career by releasing in complete form finally his complete music from the 1978 thriller the boys from brazil it also helps complete a collection of complete score releases of those projects the composer collaborated on with director franklin j schaffner they worked on seven films together and they always marked a turning point for goldsmith who admitted that every time he worked with schaffner marked his growth as a composer this score is certainly no exceptioninitially released on lp by am records with the films release it made for a very cohesive listening experience asthe composer selected various cues from the score to fashion an uninterrupted suite lasting nearly twenty minutes with the second side of the record featuring a song and two extra tracks from the score as much as i enjoyed the album it suffered from the omission of many choice musical moments which intrada has corrected on this excellent yet limited release which sold out nearly a year after its release in 2008what really stands out in this music is the composers amazing facility to immerse himself in the differing styles of such classical masters as strauss and wagner the films main theme is an amalgamation of the lilting viennese waltz he devised and the brutal seven note motif for tubatrombone goldsmiths harmonic language here is one of his most accessible and enjoyable and was generously displayed on the original album but here his harder edged action writing for the nazis is also given a large amount of exposition here one of the most outstanding moments of the score is the first previously unreleased track, the killers arrive in which the composer allows the nazi motif to make its first appearance and dominate by way of the immense brass section of the national philharmonic orchestra it is well over five minutes and gradually builds to a lush treatment of the waltz theme the strauss influence with the nazi motif obviously his take on the teutonic heaviness of wagners musicfor those out there who are die hard fans of this particular composer this is definitely one of his best works that should be in any collection like other releases of goldsmiths music from that label the boys from brazil ispresented on two discs the first presents the complete score including pieces that never made it into the finished film as heard in the film in chronological order and the second presents the original soundtrack album digitally remastered and includes several bonus features including source music and alternate versions of the hospital and the killers arrive i was lucky enough to snap up a copy when they were first released and will never part with it and was overjoyed to finally hear all the music after thirty years of hearing it in my head the booklet is excellent and full of interesting information their most recent releases in this twodisc format are patton and first blood and i cannot wait to get those like their other two goldsmith releases in this format the wind and the lion and alien those two are regular releases and not limited editions and worth having as wellbut the boys from brazil is one of goldsmiths aggressively best works of the 1970shell, his whole careerand if you can snap up a copy then do so, its a great score \n",

      " review: crossposted from the frida fantastic book bloga lot of fantasy involves a hero on a fetch quest to save the kingdom from invading hordes but what if the hero failed this is exactly the beginning of this bookthe central premise is amazing and makes this book stand out from its contemporaries epic fantasy as a subgenre seems to like its epic wars and the threat of invasion, but it does not concern itself much with a logical consequence of warcolonialism medair fetches the horn of farak, but she dooms her kingdom when she falls asleep in an enchanted labyrinth she wakes up five hundred years later to find that her homeland is no longer hers the ibisian invaders now rule the lands, and medairs disappearance and the collapse of her kingdom has become the stuff of legend her kingdoms people mostly have been wiped out, or they are of mixed blood and identify themselves as ibisiansmedair is on the wrong side of history, and has to come to terms with her homeland as a colonized space what more is that she still has the powerful artefact that is capable of nothing less than genocide while she hides her true identity, different factions pull her into escalating wars she has to decide whether to side with her invaders, and what justice really means in this new context so yes, plenty of engaging ideas therethe narrative is introspective and filled with flashbacks, but it works so well because medair is such a complex heroine she is deeply loyal to her dead kingdom, feels disgust towards the ibisians, but is also a very compassionate human being the rest of the cast is interesting even if mysterious, and the rich dialogue is filled with carefully chosen words and courtly intrigue every moment changes her relationship with the ibisians, creating an intense build up to her final decision which could alter the fate of her homelandhoumlsts intricate prose and worldbuilding is a joy to sink into i wanted to race through the pages because i could not wait to see how the story unfolds, but i forced myself savour each word i stopped to reread scenes several times because they were so emotionally powerful and i wanted to hold on to the moment but it is quite possible that i sympathized with medair so much that i also felt her sense of dreadi love how this story brings a historical understanding of culture and politics to an epic fantasy setting it is very refreshing compared to some of the epic fantasy i have read over the years where different factions are racially essentialized into a couple of simplistic traits, are forever foes, and are unchanging for millennia but i thought this novel approaches race as more of a social constructa fluid category medair notes the subtle differences in pigmentation and body type, which may be may be significant for neighbouring peoples turned colonizer and colonized, but perhaps not that significant to someone outside of those countries different ethnicities are described with certain attributes, but the attributes are ultimately cultural as medair notices, culture mixes and changes over time, and that changes how she relates to the ibisiansit is also interesting how medair becomes a political symbol an extremist group calls themselves medarists, and their goal is to overthrow ibisian power and put any person with ibisian blood into slavery they are also waiting for medairs fabled return and consequent call to arms i liked the disconnect between the politicsusingthepersonasasymbol, and the actual politics of the person herself the only other story i recall seeing this point of view is from ursula k le guins short story the day before the revolution, but medair is not an aging revolutionaryshe wants nothing to do with the movement named after her i liked the inclusion of this group, and i thought they added more depth to the politics of this worldit took a few chapters for it to really grab me, and i wanted more from the plot because i felt like it was just the beginning of something bigger some of the formal titles of the nobility are hard to remember because they are similar and all start with the letter k, but these are very minor complaints this book may be too introspective and brooding for some, but the earnest emotional core, original ideas, and beautiful prose definitely makes it reread material for methe silence of medair is an intelligent, absorbing, and poignant fantasy novel readers should take note of this work, especially if you are interested in an epic fantasy or a memorable heroine it is an excellent read and it is highly recommendednote a free review copy was provided by the author \n",

      " review: updated march 10, 2013below is my original review of the product, which i gave 2 stars have upgraded to 3 and may raise higher  after commenting about the short length of the hose to attach to an upright vacuum, the company contacted me directly and very quickly  they appear to be very interested in resolving customer concerns and approach it as a way to improve the product  at no time, did i feel the company tried to tell me i was doing something wrong  they promptly sent a much longer hose that works great  they have followed up with emails, asking for input  i have not used this long enough to give it higher ratings  from what i have read about the competeting products, i would still go with this product first  it can not break down, there are not ongoing costs for new parts  the customer service is outstanding  i have not asked, nor do i want a refund  my guess is, if i wanted to return it, the company would do  so without question  these are really nice people, that are interested in improving the product and making sure their customers are satisfied  for me, not providing a higher rating is i am not sure if home micro really has an effect time will tell  if you want to give home micro a try forget the hassles that are raised in the competing product reviews  just start with this product to give micro a test drive this is simple, low cost, and great customer servicebelow is my original reviewi was very interested in trying out a home microdermasion machine put some serious effort into researching the reviews decided that the 2 more popular machines that have vacuumsuction seemed to be prone to problems even though they have a fair share of good reviews, i decided i did not need the hassle  i found this device on another website, came to amazon and the reviews seemed promising decided to give it a try my unit came directly from amazon ordered it on a saturday, it was delivered on the following tuesday with free shippingthe reason for the low rating there just is not enough info in product description on amazon or the product website  i liked the idea of not having to pay for the vacuum function, and more importantly not having to deal with potential break down issues in the future  however, the product description is not specific enough about what size of vacuum hose it fits  from the instruction sheet  fits 125 inch round outlet there is an adaptor that helps a bit the hose must be round,  a dyson will not workif you get the basic component the microdermasion head that goes directly on the vacuum hose, keep in mind that you will be holding a 1 inch hose in your hand while your trying to do a self microdermabrasion that is pretty thick additionally, you are going to need to do the procedure while trying to manage a vacuum hose they are not the most flexible things  then there is the sanitary issue  the instructions are very clear that use wash and put alcohol on your skin before you start  but, you are using one hand to hold a vacuum hose that is cleaning throughout your house  i suggest you might want to consider this  now, this product is available with a vacuum you might want to consider that also there are some excellent small vacs on amazon in the 35 range the unit i ordered has a flexible hose about 15 inches long it is too short to avoid having to hold the vacuum hose too my vacuum hose is larger, but the adapter helps but will not keep the devices hose and vacuum connected without me holding it  so, to do a procedure i need to hold the vacuum hose and try to manipulate the tip even if the pieces go together well, the provided hose is too short to just let a the vacuum hose hang there  you do need to support it or the weight will make doing the procedure really difficult if not, unsafepossibility of scratching the skinthis product seems to have been designed when most people had canister vacs  any upright will probably have some issues i suggest that before ordering this product that you take your vacuum to the area where you would be doing the procedure, take the hose and bring close to your face and see what control you have and ability to perform the procedure as shown in the youtube videos  also, get a sense of how you feel about the sanitation issue of having the vac hose so close to you  if you order the model with the extension hose, the vac hose will still be about 15 inches awaythis product is a really good idea, they need to think it out a bit more  at a minimum add more length to the provided hose  i have not returned the product yet i have ordered a small vac with the right size hose to only use with this product \n",

      " review: saw the media hype posted on may 13th about amazon coins being the companys new virtual currency going live here in the us as a frequent purchaser of kindle editions and various business  photo apps, this one sounded interesting, especially with the announcement that amazon had announced that it would put 500 coins, which are worth 500 worth in real currency, and the email message that followed shortly after noon today confirmed thistheseamazon coinscan be used for purchasing kindle fire apps, games and inapp items from amazon on the upside, for frequent purchasers, the more coins that one buys, the greater the savings, starting with 500 coins offering a 4 savings, and 1000 coins going for a 5 discount the discounts climb, with 5,000 and 10,000 coins offering a 10 savings and the coins that one purchases are quickly deposited into your account, and have no expiration datethis started off looking like a real 5star, so i bought into it read onthough i had my 500 free coins, i weighed the discounts and bought the1000 amazon coinsoffer, giving me a total of 1,500 coins, and then i went shopping to see what i could find among a number of items that i had been considering there in the appstore i found thephotostage photo slideshow maker app, with its 499 regular price this one showed that it was compatible with my kindle fire hd 89, original kindle or my samsung galaxy s iii, so it seemed to be a good deal i could spend 499 amazon coins, leaving me with a balance of 1,001 coins from my original 1,500 coins the freebie plus the purchase, and that showed up in the upper side of the app window, making it easybut then the other side of the coin appeared, so to speaki went to explore the books, the kindle editions, and that is where i found the weakness in this amazon coins program the kindle editions, the ebooks that so many of us read do not qualify for this program if i want syl arenas excellentlighting for digital photography, it will be a regular purchase, and the amazon coins do not apply, which is a disappointment the mp3 music albums are not eligible, nor are videos, at least at the time of this reviewthis is when what had appeared to be a 5star program plummeted to a middle of the road 3star offering from amazon on the star scale, it is ok nothing more and nothing lessthere will be some who disagree with this review, and mine is a viewpoint based on short personal experience with this productservice in which i wanted to explore the possibilities of whether or not it was worth it as you can see, i went through the steps and even bought extra coins to find out how the process went for what it is, i personally have no complaints or regrets, but unless it is expanded by amazon, do not know at this stage if i will buy any additional coins once mine are gonesummaryfor families with a number of children who use a lot of game apps, this amazon coin program may be a good thing, and for this user of photo and business apps i can see using them, at least for the short term beyond that, i do not know and users considering this should also take a look at the rather lengthy amazon coins terms and conditions which fully describe that there are both promotional coins, which have an expiration date, and purchased coins, which do not expire i have posted a link to this within the comments here, but it can also be found on the product pagefor some, thisamazon coinsprogram will be good for frequent purchasers, any discount can add up over time but for those of us who are looking for a widespread plan including kindle editions, videos music and more, the program is sorely lacking whatever you decide, be sure to read the published terms5132013 \n",

      " review: zombies are all the rage these days  why, it seemed like just yesterday that vampires were en vogue, what with the twilight film series in full hype  werewolves  meh  they have gone to the dogs  today, the best scares are found in the ranks of the undead  even amc tv is getting into the craze with its stellar the walking dead program  i guess it was only a matter of time before some enterprising filmmakers figured out it was time to revisit the depths of history for some previously unexplored moments in our zombie past  you can bet the primary merchants of evil  the nazis  experimented on reanimating flesh  after all, what possible malevolence did not those dastardly villains exploitnote the following review will contain minor spoilers necessary for the discussion of plot and characters  if you are the type of reader who prefers a review entirely spoilerfree, then feel free to either read elsewhere or skip down to the last two paragraphs for my final assessment  however, if you can accommodate a modest hint of thingstocome, then read onthe time is march, 1941, approximately half a year before the japanese would attack pearl harbor and draw america into the second world war  captain martin stone played by andrew tiernan heads a small squad of american soldiers alongside a contingent of finnish men on a classified mission to destroy a secret nazi bunker  but before you can say about face, the platoon is shattered by gunfire  before the night is over, stone and the remaining survivors will have to join forces in battling the worlds greatest threat nazi zombiesthe film opens with a written script that claims that nazis experimented on the recently deceased in 1939  furthermore, the text implies that members of the finnish army joined forces with the americans to destroy the bunker involved in the research  thankfully, that is all they claim as true because it is clear very early on that there is little else even remotely possible between the opening and closing credits  war of the dead is best left to what it is pure, exploitative escapism  on that level, there is absolutely nothing wrong with it well, except maybe that not a lot of war makes any literal sensewritten and directed by marko makilaakso, war basically meanders from one action piece to another  all of them set in the dead of night with very little light but more than a fair share of flash and bang  and, as a consequence, this is only a thrill ride  it is meant to be experienced, cheered, and mostly forgotten  which is good because makilaakso  while clearly an accomplished director  pretty much gets low marks as a writerthe primary problem i had with the story and, yeah, maybe i think about things too much is that, see, they are zombies only they are not  zombies  in their most primal state  are dead  or is that the undead  i am not even sure makilaakso knows  they are essential mindless animals who are reduced to foraging for flesh or brains depending upon their tastes  their own mind only exists to pilot what remains of their body i know this to be true because once they are separated from it, they are no longer a threat  however, makilaakso as dead possess the basic attributes of zombies, but they also seem to have an almost superhuman strength whenever the director or the script requires it  yes, they do go down from a bullet or a serious blow to the head, but that is all they bear in common  otherwise, as the undead, they still pretty much function as soldiers, often seen climbing trees, clambering up buildings and over roofs, and fistfightingto complicate matters further, they seem to also retain some form of human emotions, or so we are lead to believe  for example, the finnish captain niemi  once he is been bitten and successfully smitten with zombiehood  maintains a personal quest for vengeance against his counterpart, captain stone  how or why does this happen  well, we are never told  apparently, director makilaakso has no problem with screenwriter makilaakso as script, and he never asked himself to hash it out logicallythere are other many blemishes to the story that makes it to the screen, but i will not belabor the point  as i said, i think it very clear that war was intended to be little more than a scarefest, and, on that level, it is moderately successful  it is certainly frontloaded with some excellent camera work as the viewpoint is almost constantly in motion  while it is all impressive to look at, i would have preferred that someone else had taken a hatchet to the script and produced something that, marginally, added up to something more than what was delivered  in fact, several events simply happen  stone and niemis major showdown, a kindasorta love interest, and an ending that sadly comes out of nowhere and really needed further explanation  and we are none the wiser for trying to figure this all out on our owni have read others is not it cool news and fangoria, specifically heap mountains of praise on the film, and they are perfectly within their rights to do so  it all looks grand  too bad it all felt so emptywar of the dead is produced by accelerator films, lietuvos kinostudija, media one entertainment, and rialto international  dvd distribution is being handled by entertainment one eone  as for the technical specs, most of it looks and sounds very impressive, though there was a brief sequence photographed in a makeshift ventilation duct that was fairly poorly lit  thankfully, it does not last long  how disappointed was i to learn that the disc came without a single special feature except for the theatrical trailer  booyah on you, filmmakers  you could have given us something to look at besides all of the world war ii glamor, could not yourecommended but do not be fooled all that glitters is not gold, and war of the dead glitters plenty  unfortunately, there is very little substance once the style is peeled away, and very little of the story makes any sense  still, it is a respectable b movie that serves up probably enough scares and wartime action for a nobrainer  a friday night diversion when there is nothing else on the tube  that could end up being a guilty pleasure to the right crowd  have fun with it, but, for petes sake, do not think about it too muchin the interests of fairness, i am pleased to disclose that the fine folks at entertainment one eone provided me with a dvd screener of war of the dead by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review \n",

      " review: as other reviews have mentioned, it would be nice for a 34home and travel34 charger to have folding prongs i cannot hold that against this charger, as a look on the manufacturers web site shows this to be a 34home charger34 with no mention of travel as an attribute i have submitted a correction to amazon so that the title on this site can be adjusted that certainly does not keep you from tossing it in your gadget bag and taking on the road, travelfriendly attributes like foldable prongs and dual usb connectors keep it from being as useful as purposebuilt devicesthat said, there is nothing really to complain about with this charger its styling is nonobjectionable, but i do not put much stock in styling when it comes to something like this as long as it is not ugly and it fits in with other equipment in the area, i am not going to complainthe obvious comparison is to the oem apple charger that comes with iphones smaller, cubeshaped and ipads larger, roughly the size of two of the apple 34cube34 chargers side by side this belkin mixit charger is larger than the cube charger, but roughly the same total size of the larger apple charger the belkin is shallower as plugged into the wall, but slightly taller the apple cube charger is rated for 1 a  5 v, the apple ipad charger is 24 a  52 v, and the belkin is 21 a  5 v as such, it should charge an ipad faster than the cube which is not designed to charge the ipad, but just a little slower than the apple 12w chargeri measured current draw from the belkin charger while charging an ipad 2 at 10 capacity at 018019 a 99100 watts this matched the current draw when using the larger apple charger it was also nice to see that the belkin drew such a small current when no device was connected that it did not register on my killawatt p4400 meter, so you do not have to worry about vampire draws when not charginggiven that this charger is currently about 20 and the apple ipad charger is 19, and the latter model has foldable prongs, i would go with that one instead to better differentiate it from the oem apple charger and to add some value, foldable prongs and dual usb connectors would be an excellent addition however, if you absolutely must have a charger with the styling offered by this model, i do not think you could be disappointed with this item it is a charger, and it charges, and it does not have anything wrong with it \n",
      " summary: mostly comparable to apple charger, but slightly more expensive and no differentiation in exchange \n",

      " review: 8220you never know who the lord will use perhaps one day, it will be you, ruth8221  through the line of ruth, the moabite, came jesus christ, the saviour of the worldmoody publishers has graciously provided me with a complimentary copy of this book, via netgalley, in exchange for an honest review  thank youat the market a young moabite, ruth, meets the israelite, naomi, and the two become fast, if unlikely, friends  ruth soon catches the eye of naomi8217s son, mahlon  it is not long before they are married  with naomi, mahlon, chilion and orpah, ruth finally experiences acceptance and love, and her marriage to chilion is a tender one  it is also during this time when her new israelite family teaches ruth about the lord, and as naturally as breathing ruth comes to give her heart to the lord as well8230 ruth prayed to the lord with increasing frequency  it wasn8217t a calculated, wellexamined decision  she gave it no thought  she made no conscious change of allegiance in her faith  she just clung blindly to the one who seemed to bring her a strange kind of reliefa few years into their marriage, in illness takes mahlon from ruth, along with his brother, chilion  on the brink of starvation, naomi makes the decision to return to her homeland, bethlehem, where the harvest is bountiful  naomi releases ruth and orpah from their duties to her and bids them to return to their mothers8217 houses  orpah obeys, but ruth refuses to leave naomi in one of the most famous statements from the bible 8220where you go, i will go  where you lodge, i will lodge  your people will be my people and your god will be my god8221 ruth 116as a moabite, a caananite, ruth is not welcome in bethlehem  the fact that she was once married to an israelite does not endear her to the people of bethlehem on the contrary 8220it only raises their ire more she had no business marrying a son of bethlehem8221without any means of supporting herself and naomi, ruth is forced to glean the poorest of the poor are allowed to follow the harvesters and pick up whatever wheat is dropped or left behind  the lord answers ruth8217s prayer for guidance and leads her to the field of boaz 8211 a cousin of naomi  boaz, a fair master and faithful servant of the lord, fears for ruth8217s safety in other fields, and not only allows ruth to glean in his field but instructs her to glean only in his field  he then charges his servants to intentionally drop more wheat for ruth to glean in order for ruth to provide for herself and naomiin his field, boaz comes to see ruth as a remarkable woman, far removed from the unsavoury reputation that moabite women hold  he finds her to be a patient and kind woman, brushing off the insults of others, never retaliating with harsh words of her own  more than anything boaz values ruth8217s visible love for the lord  despite ruth8217s destitute status, ruth and boaz become tentative friends  ruth never ceases to be astonished by boaz8217 character  he is friendly, fair, compassionate and generous  he treats his servants, and even her 8211 a moabite 8211 with kindness and respectruth and boaz fall in love with each other, but desperately try to hide their feelings  ruth believes she is not worthy of boaz, and boaz believes he is too old for ruth  thank goodness for naomi8217s interference, for these two are too stubborn to get out of their own waybefore they can settle into their happily ever after, ruth and boaz must learn to surrender their fears to the lord and trust him above all elsein the field of grace is fourth book by tessa afshar, and is a sequel of sorts to my beloved pearl in the sand  it tells the story of salmon and rahab8217s son, boaz, and his ruth one of the most famous love stories in the bibleas with her previous books, afshar brings to life a wellknown biblical tale in a marvellously realistic way  i feel like i have experienced indifference from a family in moab, hostility from a community in bethlehem, gleaned wheat in boaz fields, fallen in love with the perfect gentleman in an olive grove and found a love so pure it will be remembered for thousands of years  the book of ruth is a short one of only four chapters, but afshar has managed to turn ruth8217s story into a very believable account of what ruth8217s life could have been likeas much as in the field of grace and the book of ruth is about the love ruth bears for boaz, it is also about the love ruth bears for her motherinlaw, naomi  even after the death of her husband, ruth refused to separate from naomi  instead, she joined naomi in a move to jerusalem, a place where she knew she would be unwelcome at best  ruth8217s love for boaz and her love for naomi carry equal weight in this telling, a very clever touch, as historically ruth is as well known for her love for naomi as she is for her love for boaz  my only complaint in this regard and it is a tiny one is that ruth and boaz only meet approximately 25 into the book 8211 i adore boaz and i love him and ruth together, so this complaint is just me being greedy and wanting even more of themi find it wonderfully poetic that boaz falls in love with  and marries  a caananite who came to love jesus, much like his father and mother  rahab8217s pearl earrings also make their way into the tale of ruth and boaz8217 romance a lovely touch by the author that made me extremely happyi love all the colourful characters in the book  ruth is wonderful her legendary courage and loyalty is brought to life so beautifully  likewise, the character of boaz is every inch the perfect gentleman, tender and kind 8211 just like the bible portrays him  i felt very frustrated by naomi at times, but i think in that the author illustrated just how bitter naomi had become after the death of her husband and sons, and how ruth8217s love and god8217s grace ultimately healed her hurts  i adore dinah and adin and wish there was even more of themtessa afshar has become one of my favourite authors, flawlessly bringing life to tales from the bible  i eagerly anticipate each of her new books, and she doesn8217t let me down  i don8217t know what afshar plans to write next, but i am still clinging to hope for a book about lysander and roxanne from harvest of gold  here8217s hoping full review  \n",
