      "mccanns instant oatmeal is great if you must have your oatmeal but can only scrape together two or three minutes to prepare it. there is no escaping the fact, however, that even the best instant oatmeal is nowhere near as good as even a store brand of oatmeal requiring stovetop preparation.  still, the mccanns is as good as it gets for instant oatmeal. it is even better than the organic, allnatural brands i have tried.  all the varieties in the mccanns variety pack taste good.  it can be prepared in the microwave or by adding boiling water so it is convenient in the extreme when time is an issue.br br mccanns use of actual cane sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup helped me decide to buy this product.  real sugar tastes better and is not as harmful as the other stuff. one thing i do not like, though, is mccanns use of thickeners.  oats plus water plus heat should make a creamy, tasty oatmeal without the need for guar gum. but this is a convenience product.  maybe the guar gum is why, after sitting in the bowl a while, the instant mccanns becomes too thick and gluey.\n",

      "i know the product title says molecular gastronomy, but do not let that scare you off.  i have been looking for this for a while now, not for food science, but for something more down to earth.  i use it to make my own coffee creamer.br br i have to have my coffee blonde and sweet  but the flavored creamers are full of the bad kinds of fat, and honestly, i hate to use manufactured food items.  i really do not think they are good for the body.  on the other hand, i hate using cold milk or cream, because i like hot coffee.br br i stumbled across this on amazon one day and got the idea of making my own creamer.  i also bought lowfat noninstant milk powder and regular milk powder. the noninstant lowfat milk is a little sweeter and tastes fresher than regular instant lowfat milk, but does not dissolve good in cold water  which is not a problem for hot coffee.  you will have to play with the ratios  i would not do just the heavy cream, it made the coffee too rich. also, i think the powder is too expensive to just use on it is own. i like mixing 13 of each together.br br for flavoring, i bough cocoa bean powder, vanilla bean powder, and caster superfine sugar.  i mix up small batches along with spices like cinnamon and nutmeg to make my own flavored creamers.  if you wanted, you could use a fake sweetner powder instead.  i make up small amounts that i store in jelly canning jars. i also use my little food chopperfood processor to blend everything, so the sugar is not heavier and sinks to the bottom.  let it settle for a bit before opening the top though.br br this stuff tastes way better than the storebought creamers and it is fun to experiment and come up with your own flavors.  i am going to try using some essential oils next and see if i can get a good chocolateorange mix.br br all of the ingredients i mentioned are here online.  take the time to experiment.  maybe you do not use any lowfat milk. or do not add any flavorings.  it is up to you.  also, would make great housewarminghostess gifts.br br i am sure other molecular people will be able to tell you more of what you can do with it, and i am sure i will experiment with it in cooking  but the main reason i bought it was to make my own creamer and it worked out great.\n",

      "i had heard a little about this product from the local pet store, then tried a small bag for our 2 cats of about 3 and 6 years respectively. the female, younger one took to it right away, and the older male, who was unfortunately weaned on the junk cat food with all the corn meal and etc... in it, and would usually refuse a diet change, actually liked it too. the older male is overweight and we were trying to switch him to soft food on the doctors request, but he totally refused it. he is a posh cat after all. he still consumes too many calories, the fatty, but at least i know he is eating good food. of course, i know this product seems to cost more than most other feline food on the market, but i just cannot see feeding our animals the lousy alternatives that are out there, marketed as being healthy. why do commercials show cats eating a vegetarian diet which is mostly corn meal? is that right? i will stay with this for now, but stay tuned.br br i am updating this review after 9 months of using this cat food for our two cats. i upgraded the stars from 4 to 5 as it really has been a good food for the two of them. garfield still eats a little too much, but he is just a big cat who does not exercise much, let us face it. our female cat will be 4 years old in a couple months and she is so healthy. she is tiny, but happy and agile. i tried the chicken version of holistic select, but garfield seemd to miss this sardine version so we went back to this one. i have ordered the duck version and will update this once they try it.\n",

      "this packet of glaze is the secret to making those european style fresh fruit tarts. i am about to make one for a pie auction at church, after a friend requested that something strawberry should be offered. you can make the most amazing and relatively healthy fruit tarts by baking a base, layering it with uncooked, fresh, sliced fruit, then pouring over the madeup contents of one of these packets. they harden up at room temperature, hold the fruit together so you can slice the tart, and they let the beauty of the arranged fruit show through. i have also seen this glaze used over cheesecakes, to hold a fruit topping in place. personally, i do not like cheesecake too rich for me but a fruit glazed cheesecake is gorgeous, i will admit. to do this, slice fruit and layer it on the cheesecake while it is still in the springform pan. pour on the glaze, let it set up and then remove the springform. you will have a clear layer of fruit on top of the cheesecake. cherries, strawberries or sliced mangos are nice, but the best one i ever had used thin slices of lemons, that had been gently poached in sugar syrup before they were layered on the cake.br br i use a base of sponge cake, baked in a shallow form, but other bases can be pate sucre  a kind of french pastry that is a bit like a sugar cookie that works well in those fluted, straightsided forms. you can also make minitarts in a muffin pan, prebaking each mold with a layer of pie crust even commercial crust works, though again, i prefer pate sucre, it holds its shape better and is more substantial and has a better crumb. just blindbake the muffin tins lined with pate, then pop them out and fill with fresh fruits berries are great and pour over the glaze. some people put a layer of creme patisserie, which is a pastry cream like custard but stabilized with flour,  below the fruit and i happen to think these taste best.br br if you get into baking, this glaze is a musthave on the shelf. the ingredients are vegan: tapioca starch, carrageenan, dextrose, cream of tartar, locust bean gum, so if you are looking to make a vegan tofu cheesecake, you can use this on top, as well as use it for fruit tarts with a nut crust base.\n",

      "if you want an organic energy shot, your choices are this one from steaz and the assorted flavors from guayaki. guayaki yerba mate is actually in the steaz energy shot and energy drinks, and they both use sambazon acai, so there are some similarities in ingredients.br br great energy burst for 4 hours on a steaz energy shot, and no withdrawals or headaches afterwards. plan on drinking one every day at lunch at work. this will help me cut down on my iced coffees, which are not helping my calorie intake.br br already ordering 12packs on subscribe and save, 2 per month. great value.\n",
      "the best energy shot out there, smooth and organic!\n",
      "i was looking for a natural energy shot that works, and i found it. steaz energy shot is my favorite!br br i recently had gastric bypass surgery, so tons of sugar is a nono. and i am also allergic to sucralose splenda so most other energy drinks are out.br br i tried bazi energy shots and they did not work as well as steaz, and definitely did not taste as well. these have a taste that is almost like cocacolanot bad at all.br br if you are looking for natural energy, give these a try.\n",
      "fantastic, natural energy\n",
      "i had tried both of the guayaki energy shots and i do not like the taste of either of them! this one has more natural caffeine and tastes much better. i like them cold for sure. my husband and i take these on road trips in a little cooler with ice and waters and we do not have to make stops for coffee! especially on the turnpikes where it is just way too expensive. it is worth the ... per shot. we normally split them. i am really sensitive to caffeine, even the natural kind so i get a little weird if i drink the whole thing but that is the same for coffee too for me. my husband drinks the whole shot and gets a nice wake up boost. i would recommend these over any of the sinthetic shots out there. you can feel good about putting this in your body! i will be ordering again soon for sure \n",
      "way better than guayaki!\n",
      "i purchased it because it was on sale. in terms of the energy it provides, it works, but the taste leaves something to be desired. i tried mixing it with some water to make it more drinkable.\n",
      "does not taste that good but provides you the energy\n",
      "i have been feeling extremely tired around the late afternoon. as a software engineer, this is entirely unacceptable! so, i asked the nice lady at the counter of my local whole foods market, for something that will give me that extra energy i need to get through the day.br br she excitedly returned with a suspicious little green bottle. over three hours after drinking whatever that was, my brain is still working at unnatural speeds. to summarize my experiences: i believe this works.br br she did explain that i needed to drink plenty of water with it, which i personally feel helped the energy level. so if you are feeling tired during the day and hate coffee, give this a shot  preferably before you eat anything.br br woot!\n",
      "rocket in a bottle\n",
      "the energy shot truly does work! it had a terrible aftertaste at first, but now that i know what to expect, i am getting used to it. i always have some water handy as a chaser...which helps! i am so glad to have found something that gives me the energy i need without all the chemicals found in other beverages. it is helped me kick my addiction to diet coke and other aspartamelaced caffeinated beverages. yay!!!\n",
      "this stuff works!!!\n",
      "i have tried 5hour energy, red rain, nos, and other energy shots.  this is my favorite in terms of taste and effect.  plus, it is somewhat reassuring to know that natural ingredients are used.  sometimes i wonder what i am really putting into my body with some of the other brands.  i purchase a box about once every 2 months for the past 2 years.\n",
      "favorite energy shot and all natural too!\n",
      "if you are looking for an energy boost without artificial sweeteners and other chemicals, this is a great option.  the taste is decent and it is a nice smooth uplift without jitters.\n",
      "natural energy boost\n",
      "i first found steaz berry energy shots at a local organic market. i bought two bottles, which cost just under three dollars each. i fell in love instantly. the drink is delicious  i can taste the yerba mate and the acai juice, like a slightly bitter fruity chocolate honey tea. i am very sensitive to sucralose splenda which is in so many energy drinks these days; i also hate the taste. i love that steaz has actual sugar and no artificial sweeteners. the rush it gives me is slow and even. i have several medical conditions, including fibromyalgia, which saps me of energy and causes intense pain. i like how steaz helps clear away the fatigue and fog so i can get things done. no caffeine jitters, even though there are 150 mg of caffeine in each bottle.br it was becoming expensive for me to buy the bottles separately at stores, so i started looking online for a bulk price. i am so thrilled to have found the pack of 12 on amazon. i signed up for amazon prime specifically for this product, hah!\n",
      "best energy shot i have ever tasted!\n",
      "i have tried other energy shots and this one is the only one that really makes me feel good and energized without any other sides effects at all, its also the best taste, others taste like medicine, this one has a tea fresh taste. i love it.\n",

      "i drive otr...over the road truck and this helps to keep me alert. it has no sugar high  no crash. i am on a autoship which i like. the price is very good. i have seen it over 2 bucks in the store.\n",
      "tested by a trucker\n",
      "products takes pretty good, and it does not leave you gittery.  with subscibe and save as well as prime membership i pay below  2 a shot.  my wife tried them and now she drinks them like they are going out of style.  i moderate mine and they make for more effective use before weight training.  i recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a healthier alternative to high sugar and unnatural products that are everywhere that still gives you the results of an awesome energy drink.\n",
      "good stuff\n",
      "i use this product daily, and it provides a steady stream of energy.  i do not get jittery or crash.  it also helps me practice portion control because it acts as a slight appetite suppressant.\n",
      "great energy drink without artificial ingredients\n",
      "i have been buying and drinking this for over a year now, and the energy boost is excellent, with a continuous, 6hour effect. the most recent shipments seem to have improved the flavor slightly as well, or perhaps i am getting more used to it. i do not drink it for the flavor, but it is not as heinous as the fake flavors found in the other, nonorganic energy shots.\n",
      "flavor getting better, energy is great\n",
      "this is the first time i have really been misled by other reviews on amazon. i like 5hr energy, i find rain ok and so i thought i would try this product based on the reviews. boy am i sorry! i gagged getting one bottle down even with my nose pinched really. and it leaves the worst medicinal taste in your mouth afterwards. 8 tic tacs at once did not get rid of it! but worst of all, within an hour i was yawning and drowsy. unless you really like things that taste of a weird teaflavored cough syrup and do not work, do not buy this! i do not know what to do with the other 11 bottles. big fail\n",
      "so awful i can barely describe\n",
      "i loved this mold!  i wished i could have used it for more than one occasion, but it did not last.  i did use it to make 30 suckers for my daughters first birthday. but there was going to be no way that the mold could be salvaged after that.  i would have liked to have kept to use on other occasions, but for the price it did not matter to me that much.  it served it is main purpose :\n",

      "i love ordering whole bean coffee on amazon.  i like this so much that this my first product review.  i have to say that i am usually not a big fan of flavored coffee, but i thought i would give it a try.  when my husband started grinding it up, i could smell it throughout the house.  sometimes with flavored coffees, the smell is there but the taste is not.  however, not with this one.  i am now going to order another flavor from this company and will give it a try.\n",
      "very good coffee\n",
      "i love this coffee. i do wish it came already ground as i do not have a grinder and use a blender instead. but it is worth it. many flavored coffees i have tried only seem to have a flavored odor that does not reach the coffee, but this one manages both.\n",
      "very tasty\n",
      "this brand of coffee has been available in my local stores for some time  i have believe the company is local.  i have been drinking it for quite some time and have not tired of it.  i am particularly fond of the turtle sundae but all the flavors are good.  i cannot say that i have had a bad one.br br as it turns out, it is less expensive to order it from amazon and have it show up at my front door than it is for me to run out to the local walmart to get it.  it is a no brainer.  try it, if you like rich, flavored coffee, you will like it.\n",
      "excellent coffee\n",

      "hot!\n",
      "i consume about a jar every two weeks of this, either adding it to fajitas or using it as a corn chip dip.  it is hot, but after awhile the medium salsa suprema was too mild for me; i thought maybe i would cut down how much i ate by going to the hot salsa ranchera.  it is hot enough that people who are not used to it will say that is hot!.br br flavor: bright and forward.  the similarly hot salsa victoria is a duller taste to me, i guess earthy.  this salsa is much brighter in the mouth.  i do not like to go hotter than this because the sauces i have tried lose any resemblance to yummy salsa and just taste hot this happens to me with tabasco sauce, for example.br br a drawback is la victoria does not make a larger bottle of salsa ranchera nor salsa victoria, nor do they sell them in ... or sams club.  to get a good deal you have to watch for sales.\n",

      "no broken creamers!\n",

      "besides the obvious convenience and portability of the individual creamers, i liked this item specifically because of packaging. i could not believe how many reviews i read about coffee creamer cups; but many of the amazon creamer options both coffeemate and international delight had multiple negative reviews due to the shipment arriving with broken cups thanks to sloppy packaging.br br that was not an issue here. the shipment arrived in four dispensing boxes of 50 each as shown in the photo; those boxes were tightly packed in a thick cardboard box which could take a good beating before damaging the inner boxes. thus, none of my cups were broken, no waste and no sloppy drippy mess. plus the four boxes means i could put one in the kitchen, one in the bathroom we moved our mini keurig there when we upgraded the kitchen keurig  best idea my husband ever had, and one at work, with a reserve for whichever runs out first.br br if you are looking for these mini creamers but deterred like i was by the negative packaging reviews on other options, this is your best bet. as a bonus, the auto delivery price is very reasonable.\n",

      "when we received our keurig elite for christmas, we were so excited to break open the sample pack of pods to try out different blends and flavors. of the 12 pods we had in the box, four were green mountain coffee brand. i would never tried anything from this company before, but from what i had researched online, they have the largest range of keurig pods and have even bought out competitors to produce coffee under their brand names as well.br br unfortunately, i was immediately disappointed by the quality of the coffee. we tried their dark magic, decaf and breakfast blend and all were underwhelming, to say the least. i was almost completely set on writing off green mountain altogther.br br we had one gm pod left and being of the mindset of wastenotwantnot, i figured i would give it one last go around before forgetting about them completely. and i am glad i did.br br the nantucket blend is a perfectly pleasing cup of coffee. it is nice and flavorful without being thick and pungent unlike some of the other gm blends we tried. i added some flavored creamer to it and it almost measures up to our goto caribou blend pods. almost. all in all, this is a very standard cup of coffee which, while it is not anything new or exciting, is very pleasing and definitely one of the better keurig options we have been able to test out. when we run out of all the pods we have accumulated, i will probably pick up a box of these as well.br br now that i know green mountain is not completely disappointing i will definitely be open to trying a few more of their coffees with our promotion for getting the bewer we ordered a hrefhttp:www.amazon.comgpproductb004i3y4iegreen mountain coffee golden french toast,  kcup portion pack for keurig kcup brewers, 24counta to try as well and see how it goes from there.br br if you are looking for a goto choice, this is your cup!\n",

      "i was pretty pleased with these mushrooms. they were mostly large pieces, rehydrated well and had good flavor. i would estimate about 25 of the contents were broken into medium to small pieces, most likely due to the shaking about in transit. not a problem since i sometimes break the large pieces into smaller ones for some recipes. there was a small amount perhaps an ounce or so of very smallmincedsizedustlike pieces. still useful to add into gravies and the like. nothing gets wasted!br br the label says it is a product of china and italy. nothing was specified as to the proportion from each country.br br i am quite fond of dried mushrooms. while they may lack the texture you can get only when using fresh ones, the convenience of always having them on hand is a big plus. additionally, i find the broth used to rehydrate them adds a wonderful flavor to soups and stews. to save time and add flavor, i sometimes add the dried mushrooms directly into the soup or stew without rehydrating them. really helps meld all the flavors together. i also am fond of adding some to the cooking water when boiling pasta. the pasta picks up a wonderful earthy flavor when it cooks in the mushroominfused water.br br this was the first time i used the roland brand got it on a price dip from the amazon warehouse, and would certainly buy them again. highly recommend.\n",

      "i have always been a fan of kettle chips.  when you open a bag of kettle chips you know you are going to get quality.  these chips are no exception and live up to the name printed on the package.br br the new york cheddar chips  have a very subtle flavor to them.  you can taste the cheddar in them; but it does not smack you in the face like supermarket brand chips might.  the taste lingers as well which is a definite plus!br br another aspect about these kettle chips is the fact every chip is nice and crisp, that crunch in your mouth.  on top of that there are no burnt chips in any of the bags i have had since the purchase.  the only negative i might have is that the flavoring of the chips is uneven.  some chips might pack a nice cheddar punch while another might taste rather plain.  this is not a big flaw as it happens when getting seasoned and does not ruin the bag at all.br br overall the quality of the chips is fantastic.  the flavor is great and you wont be disappointed , especially if you are a cheddar lover!\n",

      "i once loved these chips and they were the only chips i would buy.  i discovered them when i was in england back in 2000 and quickly became a fan.  about a year ago i picked up a bag that was on sale at my local supermarket.  i was finding it odd that they were on sale so much but took advantage of it.  after opening the bag i found the chips were not even close to the kettle chips i was used to.  they were all uniform whitish yellow in color, flavor was way off, the lovely extra crisp brown chips were gone completely and i was very disappointed.  so i emailed kettle with the following:  what happened? i bought this bag of chips the other day and they have a very different taste; it tastes cheaper. i do not know how else to put it... i also noticed that the chips seemed to be less cooked as i did not see any of the browner colored chips that have the most flavor. i am hoping that nothing has changed with the ingredients or process used to produce this product. did i just get a weird batch? i have been buying only kettle chips for about 10 years now so i am wondering.  i did receive a reply: thanks for letting us know about your experience with your kettle brand chips. it sounds like you may have received a bag that should not have slipped by our inspections, and we apologize.our potatoes do vary seasonally which could account for a variation in colorbut our chips should still taste great!thanks for providing us with the best before code from the bag.  this really helps when passing on your comments to our staff.br we are sending some coupons to replace your purchase with any of our kettle brand flavors or nut butters, believing you will have a great experience with your next purchase! in case you buy this product again, we suggest avoiding the same best before date if you still have it in the rare instance another bag from the same case slipped by our inspections at the same time.br thanks again for letting us know about this and expect the coupons to arrive within 3 weeks.  please let me know if i can be of any more help.  well the next bag was good.  since that time i have picked up 3 bags of chips all were like the bad bag so i am pretty sure that they have changed there product to reduce cost.  i did some research and found out that kettle was bought out by a private equity company.  so the same cookie cutter management processes are probably being employed at kettle.  acquire company with high quality brand recognition, sell product to mass merchants, lower qualitycost of product to increase margin and finally sell company just before the customer base starts to realize that the brand is no longer a quality brand.  increased profits make the company more valuable on paper so they make a nice profit for the investors. customer and employees lose out of course as does an unsuspecting buyer of the exploited brand.  stay away from kettle chips they are no longer the same...\n",

potato chips, together!br br of course, this does have some advantages, because most potatochip lovers, like me!, enjoy eating several flavour, and brand varieties.  so, comparisons can be made easily.  also, as we are all potatochip lovers, but each person has his or her very favourite flavour that they are reviewing, we are, here a sort of united nations of potato chip lovers....all different, but all united in our love of potato chips!  the rest of the world can really benefit from the example of our tightlyknit, but ever...er,...expanding...group here, i think! :   but  not at first realizing that thesebr different flavour reviews were all together, did cause me a little confusion and dismay.... at least to begin with.... amazon should have mentioned that this is the kettle potato chip review forum! : br br i am happy to report that kettle chips, backyard barbeque flavour, are totally delicious!  at least they are in the oneounce bags...hopefully the same product in the 9 ounce bags will taste the same!  these are definitely chips for adults, however  andor children whose strongerthanadult taste buds can withstand the very strong flavour of these chips.  they are not the strongest flavour i have ever had...that was from a jalapeno pepper chip which was far too strong for even me!br these backyard barbeque chips by kettle, however, have just the right amount of sweetness, with honey powder, onion and sugar, to take the edge of the stonger flavoursbr paprika, chili pepper, cayenne pepper, and natural smoke flavour, of which there is less, they come further down in the list of ingredients than the sweeteners.br br the complete list of ingredients of these kettle backyard barbecue chips, in the 1ounce bags, and hopefully, in the 9 ounce bags as well, is as follows:br br potatoesbr vegetable oil, safflower and sunflower oil,br honey powder, dried cane sugar, honey,br rice powderbr sugarbr saltbr onion powderbr tomato powderbr paprikabr torula yeastbr garlic powderbr chili pepperbr citric acidbr cayenne pepperbr paprika oleoresin, colourbr natural smoke flavourbr br naturally cooked, natural ingredients.  the combination is a true taste treat!br br of course, as with all ptato chips, moderation is the key.br potatoes contain a lot of potassium....which gives energy and othr good things....but too much of which can damage kindneys.  the vegetable oil is great  but too much oil, as well as too much starch, from the potatoes, can hurt the eyes.  natural smoke flavour is so yummy....but it, as well as sugar, has  in very large amounts  been linked to cancer productionbr br as far as the starch from the potatoes and oil go, thisbr can be ameliorated, a bit, by drinking tea...which is good for the eyes.  but as far as the potassium, energy  good, too much  bad for the kidneys, and the sugar and natural smoke flavour, too much leading to cancer production  the only thing is to do what is good in everything.....m o d e r a t i o n...!br br twice or three times a month, i allow myself to go on what i call a potato chip diet.  i eat only one large bag, or the equivalent in small ones, of potato chips all day.  i supplement this with tea, coffee, and lemonade, as well as several servings of carnation instant breakfast essentials, i like the dark chocolate flavour  this adds up to fewer calories than i would normally eat, if i had my normal three meals a day plus snacks.  it also teaches me to eat slowly, because that one big bag, or many little bags, never lasts as long as i would like.  anyway, with excercise and sensible eating, the rest of the month, and keeping my scale nearby, and weighing myself at least twice a day, every day, i have taken off ten pounds in the last three months! : br br these backyard barbeque flavour potato chips from kettle,br are totally scrumptious.  except for those jalapino chips, which tasted good, but were far too spicy for my own taste buds, i have yet to meet a potato chip i did not like to eat.  these kettle backyard barbeque flavour potato chips, with their combination of potatoes, sweetness, and spices, have truly become one of my top five favourites....if not the very first favourite, of all!br br flavoured potato perfection!\n",

      "i like vernors, and drink it all the time. it is old fashioned drink from michigan, since 1866, and the labeling was known for its lovely green and gold colors and the gnome character. if you look at the can it is actually called ginger soda instead of ale and is different than typical ginger ale in taste. vernors has a strong vanilla presence, is smoother and more moist, and sweeter than a ginger ale. it is closer to a cream soda than ginger ale, very good. a ginger ale is more dry, higher in carbonation, and has a spicier bite to it. vernors has 39 grams sugar per can, versus 33 grams per can for schweppes ginger ale. neither has caffeine.br br the recipe has changed a bit over the years mostly in the choice of sweeteners. they use the same high fructose corn syrup that the costcutting mega soda companies use, rather than the cane sugar they used to use. the down side to that is that the corn syrup syrup drowns out some of the flavors. many microbrews are using cane sugar again, although it costs more, to get a better taste. vernors is still aged in oak barrels for 3 years, no doubt accounting for the smoothness. all in all a great soda for anytime. the soda is also known, like other ginger drinks, for its use as a home remedy for an upset stomach.br vernors is a regional soda, and there are many areas of the country you cannot find it in. that is why it sells here. they may be selling it in glass bottles again soon, at least there is a page that says so the day i am writing this comment. search at amazon for asin: b001jk2seg to see what i mean. vernors has quite a history, and there are two books at amazon about the soda. the first is vernors ginger ale images of america: michigan isbn10: 0738551856. the second book is the vernors story: from gnomes to now isbn10: 0472066978 a book about the companys marketing green and gold packaging with the famous gnome, and vernors fans.\n",

      "great tea\n",
      "i read the other reviews before purchasing am pleased that i did. i have purchased other numi teas and gave generally been happy with all of theri products.\n",

      "to my mind, a fine caramel should be creamy and melting.  these are grainy.  the flavor on these was fine, although a little sweet to my taste.\n",
      "not creamy...\n",
      "having eaten and reeaten my way though all of the das caramel range, this remains my alltime favorite, and the one that usually gets the most rave reviews when i share them which is not an easy thing to do  just try one and you will see what i mean.  i have been a caramel fan for ages, and while werthers butterscotch will do in a pinch, nothing has come closer to what my mother used to make than these.  they are chewy, buttery, and the little crunches of salt are spectacular ok my mother did not put salt in hers, this is an improvement.\n",
      "this caramel is fantastic!!!\n",
      "although i did enjoy the other flavor i ordered a tiny bit more, the chocolate with walnuts one, this was still a very enjoyable flavor.  wonderful service from ms. das, including a hand signed coupon for a discount on future orders, along with samples of a couple other caramel flavors.  i would order this or the chocolate and walnut flavor again for sure, along with more of das foods gourmet salt.\n",

      "where has this candy been?\n",
      "not my idea of a good caramel.  flavors of ginger and pistachio dominated.  same for the chocolate walnut and orange honey varieties. i missed the mix of rich, buttery, dairy flavor with caramelized sugar that i expect in caramels.\n",

      "the product is of high quality, and has a rich full flavor.br br delivery was unexpectedly fast.br br the only negative i would like to see addressed is that the product is packed in a heavy paper sack. while this may be commonplace, a significant improvement would be to have an inner liner of a heavy weight, food grade, plastic bag that can be sealed after each time you open the bag.  could be either a ziplock bag or a twist tie closure... does not make any difference... just need a practical way to preserve the freshness of the product and keep the bugs out of it.br br this is a health and spoilage issue... 50s of oatmeal is a lot of product and needs to either be repackaged by the consumer in small food grade bags or containers very expensive and hard to find. i am a single senior who likes to buy staple goods in bulk to save money and provide food security.  long term storage is a big issue with people like me.br br thom missouri\n",

      "i looooove pocky, got once at luckys and couldnt stop, its like the chocolate is laced with crack. anywho, the product is good, the only sad thing is that it was shipped or stored in a hot room and the chocolate melted together partially, but it didnt take too much effort to take apart the sticks.br br great product, and great price from this merchant!\n",
      "awsome\n",
      "of the many purchses i made on amazon this past december, i was most pleased with the pocky chocolate cream covered biscuit sticks pack of 10. they arrived on time, and they were a hit as a surprised gift. be sure to keep them refridgerated.\n",

      "got these for my kids as christmas stocking stuffers.  they love them.  as far as delivery, the product came in good condition, timely, and was terrific.  definitely a good buy.\n",
      "these are great!\n",
      "i am not sure how you review something that is as subjective as taste, but suffice to say that if you like chocolate and graham cracker, you will like this it does not taste exactly like either of those, but that is the closest analogy for me.  the sticks themselves are a cracker of some kind, dipped in chocolate, with one end left just normal cracker to you do not get your fingers covered in chocolate while eating.br br here is some of the nitty gritty details  each of the boxes contain two individually sealed packets, that contain probably 20 or so of the sticks.  the packets themselves are really cleverly designed, with a little slit cut in the folded part, you just grab both sides and pull, and it opens up the package without any hassle  gotta love japanese product design!  :  another nice design touch is that when you open it properly the grabbingside of the stick is right at the top.br br each of the packets has 210 calories 90 from fat, and about 80mg of sodium  so in terms of snacks this is a pretty good option.  it does contain milk, wheat, soybeans and sheanut  so if any of these are an issue for you, then you will want to pass.  it also says on the packaging that the facility they are manufactured in also processes eggs and peanuts  the product does not use either of them, but the disclosure is nice if you are particularly sensitive to either.br br overall a great snack at a great price  the 10 pack really is 20 of the packets, so that is quite a few snacks.  one note, if you live in a hot climate, do not order them in the summer because they will melt together in shipping!  duh!  :\n",
      "i love this snack!\n",
      "the chocolate on the stick was all melted and all the sticks were stuck with oneanother. the product and the concept is good but you will be better off buying it from a supermarket or directly get it from someone visiting japan.\n",
      "chocolate was all melt\n",
      "first of all, i love the packaging making it heatproof but it would not have been a problem because i ordered it it winter and they were freakishly cold. i also want to thank veryasia for the free sample of mi goreng...it was delicious!!! i now love mi goreng.\n",

      "i bought these back in january and never got around to reviewing them. i had heard many people rave about a japanese snack called pocky so i figured i would try it out. just like the description states, its a biscuit stick covered in chocolate. i would not say the taste is mind boggling but its very easy to eat and virtually no mess, well, as long as the chocolate does not melt. anyways, in case anyone is wondering, i ordered from a seller named very asia amazon.comgphelpsellerataglance.html?ieutf8isamazonfulfilled0orderid10370719445595443marketplaceseller1sellera3jw437i54sei1. i believe it took around a 3 weeks to actually get to me maybe it had to be imported but when it did, it came well packed and not damaged whatsoever. i am definitely considering restocking on this in the future if i cannot find a local storebr br edit: oct 11, 2012br br inquire the type of pocky from seller before finalizing purchasebr br so i decided to restock after i could not fight the craving anymore. unfortunately the batch this time was not so good ordered from different seller because it was cheaper and through amazon prime. what i received was not the picture shown on the front page 2 per pack japanese pocky, it was a 1 per pack pockyish thing from thailand. in my opinion, the 1 giant pack compared to 2 smaller packs is definitely a step back. packaging was fine and i ordered in october when the weather was a bit cooler aka no melted chocolate arriving at the front door. the sticks were coated in some type of thick chocolate that was a bit bitter to the taste, more similar to dark chocolate than milk chocolate. the original japanese pocky melted almost immediately in your mouth, this one melts slowly as it sits in your mouth.br br personally i like the taste of dark chocolate but not when used here as a pocky flavor. i also have terrible self control so i buy things that come in small portions in order to a not eat everything at once and b avoid making the fridge a mess by cluttering it with tons of opened items. i can honestly say that i will not be overeating when it comes to this batch of pocky because i and my stomach dislike it so much. i will not change my original rating because that still holds true for the japanese pocky but if i were to rate only the thailand pocky it would be a 3. the taste is not terrible but its definitely not to my liking. if possible i will be uploading some pictures of what i received.\n",
      "great tasting snack...if you get the japanese pocky\n",
      "bought these for my daughters grad party as well as the strawberry. she loves these things. they are a great product.\n",

      "delicious\n",
      "pocky is just plain fun to eat. i discovered these snacks at an anime convention though i would heard about them before and had seen manga characters eating them. they are very, very slim sticks of biscuity stuff the flavor to me is a cross between waffle cones and pretzels that have a charming tiny popping crispness. the chocolate flavor, a nice nonbitter, nondark, generically pleasing chocotaste, seems to be the most popular given how fast they sell out at cons, but i prefer the flavor of the strawberry which is like strawberry ice cream. very nice.br br this is by no means a health food it is in the same category as a cookie, it is got fat and sugar and nonhealthful ingredients. but hey, it is junk food. we all know it is supposed to be occasional and not habitual in the diet. unless you are really prone to bingeeating or cannot stop yourself a whole one of these smaller boxes is not a huge calorie splurge if you stick to a reasonable number. 10 of the chocolate pocky sticks will set you back 125 calories with 5 grams of fat, 3 of them saturated. i would not recommend just scarfing down multiple boxes. in fact, just nibble these slowly and have fun with the cool texture effect.br br if you love the flavor of coconutchocolate together like almond joy try the coconut chocolate ones. they are really so good, oh man. hubby says the taste reminds him of the girl scout caramel delights cookies which are, in turn, similar to the old yes yes cookies from the seventies or so.br br anyway, if you have read manga or seen anime with young folks eating those sticklooking treats, or seen footage of cute japanese girls nibbling at skinny little stick treats, this is what they were eating. : fun treats.br br however, with this crazy hot summer, i would recommend you look for a local retailer or wait until falls cooler weather. you might get a sticky, clumped mess of pocky sticks in this deep summer weather. look for local stores that specialize in japanese anime or manga and they will likely carry japanese snacks like these. in south florida, tates comics has them in a variety of flavors..and fresh and not melted.\n",
      "fun poppingcrispy sticks dipped in chocolate, special treat for manga fans, but find local or wait till fall\n",
      "pocky is an incredibly good snack, but more than that, i was impressed with very asias packaging. i had stupidly ordered something as easy to melt as chocolate in the dead heat of summer. on top of that the package of dessert pocky i ordered in 100 degree weather melted into this liquid goo. t_t so of course i was expecting all the pocky in my 10 boxes to be melted away, but they took the special care to put the pocky in a box reading protect from heat and my pocky arriving in perfect condition! well, they did stick together just a bit. i love very asia more than anything now.\n",
      "yummy\n",
      "i think the pocky did not get stored rightly. the chocolate was falling off from the biscuit stick, and does not taste as it should. many of them stick together, and whenever i want to split them up, it just becomes very messy. now i need to clean up my desk every time after i have it.\n",

      "this product must qualify for some sort of deceptive packaging award. the box only contains 5 bars and the wrappers are smaller than normal, so at least 50 of the interior of the box is air. then when you unwrap the bar you find they are only about 60 the length of a normal snack bar. the rest of it is empty air inside the wrapper. if they were to not include wrappers those 5 bars would occupy less than 25 of the space inside the box.br br as far as taste goes they are soso. on the dry side with a hint of berry flavor. celiacs, who are used to inferior products, will not be disappointed in the taste of this one.br br i have also had their cookies and they suffer from the same sort of deceptive packaging. the picture on the side of the box shows what most of us would consider a normal sized cookie. but when you open the box you find that it mostly contains a plastic tray holding cookies about the size of a quarter.br br i really want to like this company. they seem to be trying hard and coming out with new products and keeping allergens out of the production process. that is why i have continued to try their products. i bought their granola many times, always wanting to like it, but it is some of the worst food i have ever had. the clusters are hard as the partially popped kernels at the bottom of your bag of popcorn and more fitting for gerbils than people.br br all in all i would not recommend enjoy life foods.\n",

      "for those looking for a more exotic tea drinking experience and who like white jasmine tea, numis flower jewel is worth a look. about the size of a gumball, these jewels slowly open in water to form a flower shape around the central amaranth flower. they are meant to be decorative so glass teapot is a must when preparing this tea.br br decorative does not mean tasteless. as a white tea, the flavor is mild, but rich and soothing. the jasmine is wonderful but does not overpower the tea. i have had stronger jasmine teas, but this one is quite balanced and tasty. i used a small glass pot when preparing it and was able to get more than 7 yummy infusions out of the jewel before the flavor and scent began to fade. the white tea tips are plentiful and of a high quality and do not get bitter if seeped for long periods.br br i must deduct some points though for the high price to tea ratio and the fragility of the flower jewels. pouring hot water directly on them can cause pieces to fall of and after the 3rd or 4th infusion more of the flower starts to fall apart, though to be fair the main flower shape remains fairly intact. some even come out of the box starting to missing the central flower or bits of leaf. better packaging might solve this.br br if you want a tea experience that looks as good as it tastes and smells, or are entertaining and want a conversation piece, then numi tea flower jewel should be on your short list.\n",

      "my twin 10month old babies treat this one as dessert.  their first earths best jar they loved was straight sweet potatoes.  after water, sweet potatoes are the first ingredient in this one, followed by apricot puree.  that is dessert for them right there.  after that comes the chicken and then brown rice flour not as good as brown rice though.br br this is a meal that babies around the age of mine are probably almost all going to love instantly.  almost all babies love sweet potatoes for starters.  add apricot puree and there is really not much one could do to discourage babies after that.  i recommend this flavor brand.br br ingredients per label: water, organic sweet potatoes, organic apricot puree, mechanically separated organic chicken, organic brown rice flour.br br the rice flour absorbed the water and gave it a real nice consistency, and the sweet potatoes gave it a nice color.br br nutrition per label: 80 calories, 15 protein, 90 vitamin a, 2 vitamin c, 2 calcium and 6 iron.br br this one had the most vitamin a of all earths best jars i have tried.  i have been informed that the percentage of daily needs met is based on an adult.\n",
      "dessert to them.  but is it nutritional enough?\n",
      "i liked getting this one for my twin 10month olds because it has such interesting ingredients, particularly the zucchini and the garbanzo beans.  i like the fact that it is vegetarian yet i believe it has a complete protein since it also has brown rice.  this list of ingredients looks excellent and it is a green color naturally.br br the babies liked it.  they have liked everything that has carrots.br br i have the subscription for this one as i really like the ingredients and the fact that i am giving the babies food that is naturally green.br br ingredients per the label: water, organic corn, organic zucchini, organic green beans, organic brown rice, organic carrots, organic garbanzo beans, organic canola oil.br br this has 70 calories, 8 protein, 40 vitamin a, 10 vitamin c, 2 calcium and 2 iron.  i have been informed that the percentage of daily needs met is based on an adult.\n",

      "my daughter was not a big fan of baby food, especially any with proteins, but she did love this one! the flavor is just right, not too sweet or too savory, and does not have a strong chicken flavor. almost like plain sweet potatoes but not as sharp, thus it is a very good first protein to offer, and good for picky eaters. my nephews and my niece also liked this flavor, so it is a pretty safe bet to keep on hand if you do not know a particular babys preferences.br something i wish i had known was that it is quite a bit runnier than other stage 2 earths best, especially for having chicken. i added quite a bit of rice cereal to thicken it up after my daughter had gotten tired of the runny texture, and she liked that just fine, but it is an extra step. however the runnier texture makes it workable for younger babies or those with gaggingtexture problems.\n",

      "on a trip to italy, muesli is what all the hotels had for breakfast as their cold cereal and i loved it.  imagine how excited i was when i saw that kellogs sold this product.  what did i learn?: despite the similar name, this cereal is quite unlike europeanstyle muesli.  while the overall mix of grains and fruits is similar, this cereal is mostly a flake cereal, while a true muesli has no cereal flakes at all.br br real muesli is made of rolled not flaked grains; this has pluses and minuses.  on the plus side, milk does not turn european mueslis to mush in a couple of minutes like it does flake cereals.  on the minus side, european mueslis have to be soaked in milk or yogurt for about ten minutes or so i.e. while you are in the shower, or while the coffee is brewing or the cereal will be a bit on the chewy side.  for those that are concerned about eating processed foods, rolled grains have been processed less than flaked ones.  rolled grains are lightly steamed and then rolled and lightly toasted; flaked grains are fully steamcooked until they are mush, pressed into flakes, fully baked and then usually sprayed with sugar to extend timetomushiness.  and certainly only the kellogs product contains hfcs.br br you owe it to yourself to try one of the many other mueslis from amazon or better yet, single boxes from a local healthfoods store if you have one and see what you prefer.  i eat the bobs red mill product available on amazon and one of my local grocery chains instead of this, and am much more satisfied.  i have not tried familia but i am not crazy about the idea of the fruit flakes, and the dorset products are too fruit and nut heavy for me.  the other products are a hair more expensive than the kellogs, but i am willing to plunk down an extra dime or so per breakfast for a far superior product.br br i am surprised quaker does not sell a muesli product...  given that they have to be the largest producer of rolled grains in the u.s., you would think it would be a natural fit for them.\n",

      "totally fantastic\n",
      "they claim this product is unadulterated, which would make you think oh! sweet! it is going to be the best, because nobody elses coconut oil says it is unadulterated.  i checked out their website, and for those of you who do not know... you want to go for cold pressed oils. if they are not cold pressed, it means they have been processed with major machinery and subjected to high heats, which as anything goes, can and usually does, kill any good minerals and vitamins. their site posts information on their extraction process. as of today, this is what it states:br br manila coco oil extraction method is through a proprietary, stateoftheart mechanical expeller manila virginflo, thermostable to hold off the lowest moisture possible 0.1 to avoid rancidity and keep shelf life consistent up to 3 years under normal conditions. our oils are 1st and 2nd stage pressinduced, without chemical solvents, no bleaching, no deodorizing, no hydrogenation, no fermentation enzymes  to keep its natural light sweet coconut aroma and taste. this method sustains its unique character even when subjected to high up to 170 degrees celsius heat temperatures.br br mechanical expeller is their form of extraction. and they also say it sustains unique character... blah blah blah... when subjected to high heat temperatures. therefore, in my personal opinion, it is not as unadulterated as their information on their products on amazon make them sound. i will be steering clear of their products.br br i am sorry if my review offends some, but if you are going to pay good money for something, you should know about it. i would use different brands before sticking yourself with this one. i was looking for larger quantities, which is why i looked at this product, however i will be sticking with nutiva. as their coconut oil is cold pressed soon after the coconuts are cut open. the information below is direct from their website.br br what makes nutivas virgin coconut oil so special? much of the magic lies in the way the oil is processed. within several hours of the coconuts being chopped, the meat is coldpressed, unlike other varieties of coconut oil which can be left for more than 10 hours before pressing. nutivas approach preserves as much of the oils natural color, flavor and aroma, giving you the best results for any use.br br if you do not care about how it is processed, it is still going to be much healthier than your average grocery store found vegetable and canola oils. if you want to read some scary things, look up the dark information on how those are processed. yuck! talk about horrifying.br br thank you for your time.br amybr br ps. i used to be one of those organic? what kind of fruitcake are you? think you are more special than anybody else? people. but i have learned so much in the past year and a half, dealing with my sons allergies and intollerances. there is more to it than oh it is more expensive, so it is just making me feel special because i can afford it. no. there is way more to it than that. i urge everybody to talk to people about organic foods. it is a way of life, a healthier way of life. we all deserve to live healthier. if you live healthier, even though it costs more, in the long term you are saving money because you are healthier. so that means less doctor visits, less expensive and nasty harmful medications, etc.\n",

      "for christmas i ordered some coupons from my daughters school for 30.00 off ohama steaks.  i was excited to try them as i have been bombarded with their ads for the last 2 years and i was ready to test them out.  i went online and looked at their packages and was so looking forward to receiving my package of fine foods and cook them.  i made my choice and fell for some of the last min. addons, by choice.  i went to pay and use the gift cards and well you can only use one at a time, having 2 for 15.00 i naturally thought i was getting 30.00 off the total.  with that said i was still willing to go ahead with the order.  129.00 later i had ordered one of the package deals and the addons.  i received my order ups in 57 days packaged in a styro cooler.  packaged in the cooler were several cardboard boxes with vacuumed packaged tiny steaks.  i am a person who loves to grill and do so about 4 nights a week, so i know a little about meat, and how to cook it.  first this is not high end dryaged meat or wet aged this is inferior to quality meat that can be bought at a good butcher.  the steaks are about 30.00 a pound after shipping and the high prices.  the hamburgers are tiny frozen pucks that are dry.  i am so disappointed in the quantity and quality, i really have no words to describe how disappointed i am with this whole deal.  to top everything off i received a email coupon for 20.00 off my next order so the coupon that i purchased was 5.00 more than online deals.  wow do yourself a favor and spend your money in a good butcher shop of grocery store!!!\n",
      "over rated way over pricedfrozen meats\n",
      "these are actually very tasty.  pure potatoes with a great texture and no nasty filler stuff.  no bacon, no cheese...just tasty potatoes.  they cook well in either the oven or microwave.  i add a touch of either salt  pepper or fajita seasoning to spice it up.  i rated 4 out of 5 stars because they could be a bit bigger portion.  however, this item is a fairly good value for the money.\n",
      "i like these!\n",
      "these are actually pretty good little potato puffs, and best of all  no cheese!  unless you like that sort of thing, which we do not so it is nice to actually find a potato side dish with no cheese in it.br br anyways  these are surprisingly good and they toast up nicely in the oven in like 10 minutes.  worth it for 10.\n",

      "i received 4 of these in my first ever omaha steaks order that i received today. i was not sure what to expect, but so far, i have been pleased. i tore the plastic open, put the frozen potato on a baking sheet in the oven and put it on 350. 45 minutes later it was done and turned out being delicious. the cheese filling was crispy ontop and the potato itself underneath was nice and soft. no way would they come out as good if put in the microwave, so i would say oven cooking these is definitely the way to go. now, you can obviously make your own stuffed baked potatoes for far cheaper then what omaha charges for these alone, but as long as you get a good deal on the omaha website, these simply make a great addition to any omaha steaks order. as delicious are they are though, i would not order a box of just these off the site due to the added shipping costs. but like i said, as long as they are part of a nicely priced packaged deal, i will definitely take them. actually, i probably would not order any packaged deal in the future from omaha that did not include these. a big plus, at least for me, is if you check the ingredients list on these, there is no partially hydrogenated oils, so there is no traces of trans fats, which is very rare with stuffed baked potatoes. also no high fructose corn syrup, which is another rarity on a food product like this and is always a plus. if you make your own or buy them frozen from your grocery store for example, chances are, the butter used, sour cream, etc. will be full of chemicals, trans fats  high fructose corn syrup. these, not so much. so there is a definite degree of quality with omahas stuffed baked potatoes. each potato does have 8 grams of saturated fat, which is 42 the drv, but that is obviously to be expected with anything that contains bacon, cheese and sour cream. i was also expecting there to be no fiber, but it turns out there is 3grams of fiber per baked potato half. another plus. overall, the stuffed baked potato was very tasty and actually relatively healthy, being made with quality ingredients.\n",

      "january 3, 2011br br i purchased these potatoes from omaha steaks online last week. i was not sure what to expect ... the au gratin potatoes i had seen and tasted before were sliced potatoes with globbs of gooey cheese sauce, and by the looks of them, this certainly was not it ... i opened the box and got out my skillet. the first thing that i noticed is that these things were huge ... like a gigantic tater tot. i browned them on both sides about 10 minutes each. to my surprise, they were very tasty. texture was light fluffy and the potatoes tasted extra fresh .. not frozen or freezer burned. i liked them alot. i think these are perfect for kids ... none of the flavors were overpowering and great texture ... i give these 4 stars.\n",

like the other reviewer said, he ordered something that said alive and aware in the description and when it came it was from saquinhalal everyday.  who knows. i just want some more transparency so i can have more trust when ordering from amazon.br br for now, i am going to seek out another source, not through amazon, that stands behind their cacao. it is very important to me, for health benefits and the ecologicalsocial impacts of where it is harvested, to know that i am getting topnotch, certified organic, raw cacao. if amazon is going to be so wishywashy and sneaky, i am going elsewhere. wagging finger at amazon!br br i think for now i will leave the following review for alive and aware in case they do bring it back.br br heavens to besty, this stuff rocks!! it is such a good value too, maybe the best out there as i have def shopped around.  i have tried a few different brands of raw organic cacao powder, and this is certainly topnotch.  kudos to alive and aware for offering it at such a reasonable price!!br i am not a raw foodie per say, but i try to follow a neopaleo protocol which includes super foods such as raw cacao.  properly prepared, with just enough natural sweetener, i think this is a truly guiltfree pleasure.  it is loaded with antioxidants, as you probably know.  so go ahead, get the big bag.  you can then share it with friends and family and turn them on to this super groovy super food of the gods theobroma as they say :br my favorite way to consume it is actually as not so hot cocoa i just whisk it into gently heated fresh raw whole milk or cream so it is not too hot and to preserve as much nutrients as possible, i know it is not 100 raw  but hey this is how i love it!, add just enough sweetener i like sorghum molasses, a scant tspoon, a bit of maca powder, a dash of real salt, and after that is thoroughly whisked i top it off with a spoonful of evo coconut oil yumm!!! i have converted everyone, even the kids i babysit who used to prefer swiss miss. or i make a concentrated warm cocoa beverage sans maca and coconut oil and then stir it into my raw milk for a half gallon of raw chocolate milk, lightly sweetened.  you better believe it goes fast!!  i love my family to get their good old fashioned grass fed animal fats with bioavailable vitamins a, d and the x factor read weston a price and loads of antioxidants from the cacao to boot.  plus cacao activates the seratonin receptors and sorry i am bit fuzzy but you know it makes you feel good and happy!!br also process it with evo coconut oil and sweetener such as sorghum or honey or maple syrup in your cuisinart for heavenly truffles refrigerate for proper texture due to coconut oil.  i often toss in soaked,dried nuts and dried unsulfured fruit and shredded coconut for healthy truffle energy bars. just process in batches so it is kind of homogenous. like those lara bars but cheaper and no packaging and even organic or raw.br go for it! buy this huge bag, share the goodness and you will be healthier and happier for it. i guarantee!!  peace be with you!\n",

      "raw cacao powder differs greatly in taste than processed cacao powder. commercial cacao powder is often triple fermented and then roasted. commercial companies are more interested in a product which has no nutritional value but great consistency in flavor. commercial cacao powder is mono tonal in flavor. raw cacao is everything that commercial cacao is not. it is a antioxidant superfood which has no equal. the taste does vary slightly from one part of the year to the next. as to taste, it has a wonderful intoxicating tannin like aroma with mild overtones of mahogany. in foods it has a complexity which some cooks will absolutely love while the others who read from the book may want to go back to there standard one dimensional cacao. in baking, i believe it goes well with other flavors such as almond extract. if you want to do an extraordinary butter cream icing with a tad of almond extract, your icing will have no equal. in chocolate cake i personally would go heavy and do a buttermilk or sour cream cake. the acid helps to unify and amplify flavors. i like making cake with 60 cake flour which is about has about 5 wheat gluten and 40 rice flour. the reason for this should be obvious. the heavy texture that rice flour imparts makes your cake stand proud and one bite is then never more than enough.br br raw cocoa powder is rich in polyphenols, such as catechins and procyanidins, and has been shown to inhibit lowdensity lipoprotein ldl oxidation and atherogenesis in a variety of models. human studies have also shown daily intake of cocoa increases plasma highdensity lipoprotein hdl and decreases ldl levels although the drug companies having endeavored to understand the mechanism in which this happens.\n",

      "i have mixed feelings about nunaturals nustevia white stevia with maltodextrin powder and will probably not purchase it again.  do not get me wrong, it is a great tasting stevia extract and very easy to use, but it is just 6.4 percent stevia and 93.6 percent maltodextrin filler.  in other words only 6 pennies of each dollar you spend on this stuff is buying you high quality stevia extract powder.  in my opinion, this is unnecessarily dilute; however, it does make it exceptionally easy to measure.  if the labeling said 6.4 stevia extract, i would have passed on this from the beginning as i can get 70 dry stevia extract of the same quality for much less money per serving of stevia. if this is your first time buying stevia, go for it as it is easy to use and tastes great.  if you are accustomed to buying and using concentrated stevia extracts, you will be probably be disappointed by the low concentration of this products mixture.br br pros:br  5star tastebr  easy to measurebr  perfect for firsttime stevia usersbr  34 tsp  1 tbsp cane sugarbr br consbr  only 6.4 steviabr  not costcompetitive with 70 or pure dry stevia extractsbr  34 tsp  1 tbsp cane sugarbr br overall, a good product but not the best value.  i would given it 4 stars if the product labeling did not try to hide the fact that it is just not very potent.  for about 13 to 12 the cost of this product, you can buy concentrated stevia powders and cut them yourself with a lowcost filler like maltodextrin and come out ahead or just use them full strength, which is often easier once you get used to the sweetening power of pure stevia.br br in case you are wondering where i got the 6.4 by mass value from, this is how i calculated it.  on a precise scale, i found the density of this product to be 2.5 grams per teaspoon.  the label says it contains 40mg per 14 tsp.  thus, 1 tsp has 160mg stevia extract in 2500mg mixed powder.  the concentration mass comes to 64mg stevia per gram of product or 6.4 percent by weight.  pretty weak stuff, but still much sweeter than cane sugar.\n",

      "i have tried every brand of stevia on the market and this is, hands down, the very best out there.  i use nunaturals nustevia for all sweetening purposes.  it can be hard to find even in health food stores and the ones that carry it usually charge a premium.  i was delighted to find it on amazon.com for a very reasonable price, even less when obtained through a standing order.\n",
      "perfectly, naturally sweet!\n",
      "this stevia is the best tasting we have ever tried. it also mixes into beverages more thoroughly than some others.the service from this buyer was prompt, the product arrived on time and in excellent condition. would order from them again, and recommend them to others.linda blyth\n",
      "the best stevia\n",
      "i ordered this after having much success with their liquid products. it is not bitter at all and has a very freshclean taste to it.  i have baked with it, used it on the stove, and in my oatmeal and hot cocoa.  when i run out, i will be ordering more!\n",
      "love this stuff!\n",
      "nunaturals stevia is the only sweetener that i use in my beverages and cooking. i have tried other brands and this one is the best! it has not any odd taste, and tastes better than sugar to me. i buy the large 12 ounce container and it lasts me for months! i only wish they would put this in more products sold at the grocery stores. there is a soda that has stevia in it that i purchase at a health food store called virgils zero and it comes in different flavors...it is great and i do not have to be concerned about the sugar content that is in traditional sodas. this product is great and i think is the best of stevia products on the market.\n",
      "the only sweetener i will use\n",
      "i find that this jar product works better for people without as much dexterity in their hands; vs usingopening sweetener packets.  this product works well both in cold  hot things like homemade lemonade  in coffee.  easy to open lid. product dissolves more easily in cold liquids, than many other types of stevia.\n",

      "best stevia product i ever used\n",
      "nustevias white stevia powder is amazing!  i have been on a lowcarb diet for the last year and have lost 27 lbs, and nustevia products were a big help with the success of my diet.  i love sweet things, and without them i do not think i would have been able to stay on the lowcarb diet.  i have been unable to eat sugar for a long, long while.  i had previously switched to natural sweeteners like honey and agave, but when i discovered they were not on the lowcarb diet i would switched to, i had to find something else to use as a substitute.  nustevia products are what i chose.  i tried several other types of stevia, but nustevia products seem to be the best so far.  the bitter aftertaste associated with most stevia products is almost completely absent from nustevia products.br nustevia white stevia powder is super sweet, so you will have to use it sparingly, and one bottle lasts a very long time.br i am very happy with the product and will be buying it again and again.\n",
      "sweetly satisfying...\n",
      "the first time i tried this product  was 2 years ago at the venetian spa restaurant in las vegas  having  a cup of tea with some friends. we all remarked how delicious and tasty it made our tea.  we have been using it ever since. a little goes a long way and i use it anytime i would ordinarily use a sweetener.  since the artificial sweeteners are so unsafe and unhealthy and i have a sweet tooth, i felt this was a safe alternative. not only is it safer, but there is no aftertaste and does not raise your blood sugar level. this particular stevia has absolutely no bitter taste to it. i have tried others before and since and there is no comparison.\n",

      "worst caviar ever\n",
      "this stuff is not bad at all. but you know how you can just eat spoon after spoon of really good caviar without toast points or crackers or anything? this roe is more for sprinkling over fish dishes, morning eggs or a caesar salad. all in all, for the price, it is pretty good,\n",

      "it is fast.  it is food.\n",
      "i have tried several of the compleats line, including this one, and they all have one thing in common: the picture on the box looks like a lot of food with a moderate amount of sauce on it, but the box actually contains a moderate amount of food with a lot of sauce on it.br br the chicken and rice flavor has some shredded chicken with rice, carrots and peas and a whole lot of chickeny flavored sauce. it is very salty but not lacking in chicken flavor. the texture of all of the ingredients is decent, neither too firm nor too mushy, except for the ratio of sauce to solid food being too saucy. overall, i would say it is fine in a pinch  these shelfstable meals are easier to find than most  but if you have other options available, these are only fairtomiddlin.\n",
      "not bad\n",
      "these radiationtreated dinners that do not need freezing are a great convenience.  i have tried quite a few of the hormel compleats and this is one of my favorites.  home cookin, it is not, and it is a bit too salty, but for a satisfying meal in 90 seconds, it is hard to beat.  the only reason i have given this flavorful, decently chickenfilled dish 4 stars instead of 5 is because the rice is white.  we all know by now that whole grains are healthier, so, until these companies start making their dishes with whole wheat pasta and brown rice, i will mark them down.\n",

      "my question followed by their reply  very good customer service!!br br hey guys,br so we are trying to feed a new born as much breast milk as we can, however there is not enough to meet his nutritional needs.br so a formula is in order as a supplement. with that, we are interested in your toddler formula, and it appears that since this meets the fda infant formula guidelines, that it should be safe, and opinions on the internet seem to feel the same way. however, our doctor says that it should not be used because of the higher amounts of calcium and phosphorous. he was also concerned about using the dhaara supplement with concerns about the egg white process and that the proteins in egg whites are not good for an infant. any thoughts on this? thanks!br br their answerbr br dear dave,br br thank you for contacting natures one.  firstly, you are correct in that our babys only organic formulas meet the nutritional requirements of the fdas infant formula act. no dilution is needed for babies under 12 months of age. please follow label mixing instructions.br br regarding the calcium and phosphorous content in babys only organic formulas, calcium is an essential nutrient needed for bone health. the american academy of pediatrics expert panel for nutrient levels in infant formula has provided recommendations on the amount of calcium with the minimum per 100 calories being 50 milligrams and the maximum being 140 milligrams per 100 calories. phosphorus is another important mineral for bone health. the expert panel has also recommended that the calcium to phosphorus ratio in an infant formula be no less than 1.1 or more than 2.0. babys only organic falls within these ranges with our calcium at 135 milligrams per 100 calories and a calcium to phosphorus ratio of 1.5.br reference: committee on nutrition, pediatric nutrition handbook, the american academy of pediatrics, 2009, pages 12451246.br br the balance between calcium and phosphorus is most important for bone development. the calcium to phosphorus ratio in both babys only organic formula and enfamil nextstep is 1:5. thus, babys only organic formulas provide an appropriate ratio of calcium and phosphorus for toddlers and an appropriate overall quantity of calcium and phosphorus.br br regarding our babys only essentials dhaara supplement, the dha utilized in our babys only essentials dha  ara supplement is sourced from egg yolk phospholipids. you are probably aware that most often an egg allergy is caused by the egg white rather than the yolk. additionally, it is the protein component of foods that usually elicit an allergic reaction. because we use the phospholipids not protein from the egg yolk, there is only a very minute chance that an allergic response will ensue.br br if your child has a history of allergies, we highly recommend that you consult your childs healthcare provider.br br dha is also found naturally in other foods, including oily fish like trout, sardines, tuna and salmon and the yolk of eggs. dietary ara is available from animal meats, dairy foods, eggs, peanuts and nori seaweed. as your child increases the variety of foods in her diet, you can include some of these foods in her diet. other natural sources of dha would include fish oil or fish oil supplements. unfortunately, it is difficult to insure that these are free from mercury or other environmental toxins. but, also remember that these fatty acids can be formed from dietary linoleic and linolenic acids nuts, seeds, grains legumes, vegetables and their coldpressed oils. by including good sources of high quality fats in the diet, your child will easily be able to meet her specific needsbr br most egg allergies are a result of ingestion of egg white; egg yolk allergies are rare.br br proteins are the component of foods that cause allergic reactions. egg allergy is usually due to the proteins in the egg white. these protein allergens are: ovomucoid, ovalbumin, ovotransferrin; lysozyme, and ovomucin.br br however, there can be a rare situation of egg yolk allergy. the literature to date usually associates egg yolk allergy to a reaction triggered by inhaled bird allergen, referred to as birdegg syndrome. this is a very rare syndrome.br br egg allergy can also be seasonal. oak pollen, short and western ragweed and the goosefoot family of weeds may cross react with eggs when these pollens are in season.br br the estimated point prevalence of egg allergy in children is 1.6 by 2.5 years of age. 1 again, egg white is usually the cause of an egg allergy. most children outgrow an allergy to eggs by 5 years of age.br br  1 eggesbo m, botten g, halvorsen r, magnus p, the prevalence of allergy to egg: a populationbased study in young children, allergy 56; 5:403br br i hope this information is helpful to you. thank you for your interest in babys only organic formulas. please let me know if you have additional questions.br br sincerely,br br loribr natures one inc.br ...br ...br toll free ...\n",

      "harmony farms produces excellent dog food products!  our 8 month softcoated wheaten terrier is sensitive to gluten, corn meal and other products generally found in the popular  brands.  we were preparing to take him to the vet at about 4 months old bc he had great difficulty eliminating  to the point of whining as he would attempt to go.  after more research on the breed we purchased harmony farms at a local store  it was expensive but quickly resolved our puppys digestive issues.  after 58 days on only harmony farms products our puppy was happy and healthy!br br i was so happy to find harmony farms on amazon!  it is more economical and delivered right to our door.  our puppy, connor, eats only harmony farms dog food and treats and is a much happier puppy now. definitely recommend it for softcoated wheaten terriers and other breeds that have difficulty digesting the popular brands.\n",

      "the main ingredients in this dog food are so much better than the ingredients in the common grocery store brands, and it tends to be less expensive than specialty brands.  my dogs coat looks shiny and he seems much healthier since we switched to this food about a year ago.  the other nice thing is that target sells this brand, so if you ever find yourself at the end of the bag and you have not ordered more in time, you can stop by target.\n",
      "very good\n",
      "i am very pleased with this dog food. my sheltie has a good coat and good movements with harmony farms. does much better with this food than others. he is a very picky eater, so i do add chicken and he will eat. we will stick with harmony farms. i also like the bag, it helps keep the food fresh.\n",

      "i have a nearly 1 year old golden retrieverstandard poodle mix, and a 6 year old german shepherd. the doodle gets the chicken and  brown rice just switched her a few weeks ago from nutro max and the shepherd gets the healthy weight. i have tried several different foods for the doodle, and many of them caused problems like diarrhea and stinky, stinky farts. with this, while switching from the nutro max, she had none of those problems. in fact, i only took 5 days to switch her instead of 2 or so weeks, and she did not have any digestive problems. both dogs seem to like it and it is definitely cost effective... several dollars cheaper at my local wegmans and there are always coupons in the paper. this is a very high quality food for the price, and i like that it is available at the grocery store as i live in a small town. i highly recommend this food and hope to feed it exclusively for as long as my doggies shall live!\n",

      "fabulous food!\n",
      "i purchased this because of the good reviews and the great ingredients. no doubt about the quality of the food and my 5 month old dachuhund puppy loves it. but i realized this does not have dha that helps to develop cognitive brain function. also the kibble might be little big for a puppy. so i believe it is a great food for an adult dog, but i would not recommend it for a puppy.\n",

      "in my opinion, this is the best food for dogs.  my boyfriend is an avid researcher, and he concluded this is the bet food for dogs on all accounts  taste the dogs love it, healthwise it has healthy fats, and the first and main ingredient is meat as opposed to ingredients such as corn and digestionwise the dogs get diarrhea when they eat human food or any other dog food.  we have two dogs we adopted from a shelter, and while at first, one of our dogs would not eat the food he had worms though, so who knows what junk he was eating before, he soon began to understand that is what we were going to feed him and very soon, he came to love it.  now they jump when it is dinner time!  our dogs are happy, very healthy, have shiny coats, and a large part of this is due to this fantastic dog food.  we get it on subscribe and save and we usually go through 1 bag p month  for reference, we have one 15lb bichon and one alaskan husky.\n",

      "just to give a little background  i ordered these because they were a great deal for a box of single serving chips and i thought i would give them a try.  the variety of flavors in this package was great and i enjoy most of them.  these chips leave a lot less mess than your average bags of potato chips and there are very few crumbs in the bag.  it is apparent these are not prepared like normal chips and the result is a differently textured chip.  it will be a personal taste as to whether or not you will like the taste and texture, but, i would highly recommend trying these out.\n",

      "just my 2 cents...\n",

      "these really are good i gave some to other people and they liked them too. the plain flavored ones take well to using them as scoops for your own dip or salsa. when eating the bbq flavored ones brings back memories of yester years when i would eat bbq pork skins while riding in the back of the truck on the range. i think the pepper ones could use more pepper but they are all still good and make a good snack or side dish to lunch at 100 cal per pack.\n",

      "i picked up a 3 oz bag of the salt and vinegar chips last weekend at wegmans and in a blink of an eye, the bag was gone.  very nice vinegar flavor.  bad side was in a blink of an eye they were gone which is not good for portion control.  i ordered the variety pack in .8 oz size single serving to help with portion control.  most of the flavors i like  but fair warning, the parmesan garlic is very garlic. love the salt and pepper.  with 100 calories a pack, what a nice change from baked chips.  try it  you will like it.\n",

      "popchips are really, really good! do not expect a regular old, greasy potato chip, but do expect something equally awesome that stands on its own. popchips do not leave any funny residue in your mouth like some other diet chips, and they do not have a lot of fat and calories  only 100 cal. per singleserve bag! i got the variety pack, and liked every one of the six flavors  some better than others because i am not a big fan of cheddar chips by any maker, so these were as good as any, but all were good, most were great. even nondieters who tried them liked them. it seems like they cost a bit more than the average bag of chips, but maybe that is because i had to buy a case. even so, they are worth it if you are fighting the battle of the bulge and want a local indulgence you would not otherwise be able to enjoy. my recommendation: eat popchips!\n",

      "i expected..idk..maybe tasteless cardboard...but these are really good..i have only tried the bbq so far..but it packs a lot of flavor and you get a lot of chips in a single serving bag!  i will update after my family beach trip because i am taking the 24 pack with us for some moderately healthy snacking..my only caveat is..these could prove to be addictive..i am looking to watch my weight..and these are definitely a temptation!  very happy with this product:\n",
      "very happy surprise\n",
      "i order these chips on a regular basis.  if you are doing weight watchers, these chips are 2 points a bag.  when this particular shipment arrived at my house, it was poorly packaged.  i received a case of crumbs instead of a case of chips.  this is the 1st time in the four times that i have ordered these, hopefully it will not happen again.\n",
      "great chips, poor packaging\n",
      "i love popchips and this was really a treat to get the variety of flavors and the individual bags were such convenience! thank you!\n",

      "best healthy potato chip!\n",
      "i luv me some popchips!!  these are great snack items.  i ordered a case, and passed them around my office.  now everyone is addicted to these chips. i have not found anyone that did not like these chips...and they are healthier than the baked chips out there. yumm!!\n",
      "i luuuv me some popchips!!!\n",
      "popchips do not taste like a lot of the other lowfat salty snack options.  they are light in taste and big on crunch.  great alternative to potato chips.  i am not a fan of the bbq flavor but i do like the sea salt  vinegar, salt  pepper alot and sour cream and onion.  like the individual bags  perfect for on the go and lunches.\n",
      "good crunch  light taste\n",
      "when i found these chips i was shocked to see how little fat there is in these. they taste great and the are actually not bad for you either. i told my sister, and she has told her friend everyone loves them after they try them. we order boxes so we can have them at work instead of using the vending machines, the office loves them. they can be a little hard to find, that why i order the online.\n",
      "pop chips are great\n",
      "this 24pack lasted about a month, and i sampled all of the flavors but only got to eat the barbecue flavor once, as it is my wifes and my favorite. so, i reordered just the barbecue. great snack for 100 calories. i have purchased the reduced fat pringles 100calorie individual packs before, and you get a lot more chips in a popchips bag than from pringles.\n",
      "good way to try the different flavors\n",
      "great product! all the flavors were delicious. loved the fact that the single serve bags were about 100 calories each.\n",

      "great purchase\n",
      "i am very impressed with the flavors. all of them! there were a few flavors i was not sure i was going to like....but they are really good also! the flavors are very intense. you are not getting a bland chip. i am on the monthly plan but i have already had to order them ahead of schedule twice!\n",

      "pop chip goodness\n",
      "popchips are very good!  i am on a mission to lose weight and these have replaced high calorie snacks.  i think i even like these better than regular chips!  the bbq, salt  vinegar, and cheddar are really good alone and i am not normally a bbq chip person.  i tend to eat the original, sour cream  onion , and the salt  pepper with laughing cow cheese as a dip.  i do not really care for the salt  pepper as much as the others because i do not really like pepper in general and these are very peppery.  i wish they would replace the salt  pepper with the parmesan garlic flavor.br br also, i like to buy these small packages to limit my portion size, but also because there are a lot of chips in this one little bag.  it also makes it really convenient for me to grab a few bags and take them to work or throw a few in the car.  i do not have kids but the small bags would be nice for kids as well.\n",

      "if i had to describe a popchip, i would say that it is a hybrid of a  potato chip and a popcorn cake.  i was a little skeptical, at first, since i was trying to figure out how they were made if they were not baked or fried, but i was pleasantly surprised when i tried them.  this variety pack gives people a good opportunity to try the six different flavors and decide which ones are their favorites.  if you are a snacker or if you are looking for a healthier alternative to fried potato chips, this are a musttry.\n",
      "everyone should to try these at least once\n",
      "i liked most all of these except for the cheddar ones.  these are packed with flavor and are a great alternative to regular potato chips as well as being just 80 just as good.br br the best way to describe these is that they are like rice cakes except make from potatoes.  i hate rice hates but loved these just the texture is compared to rice cakes not the flavorand i will definitely purchase them again in the future.br br i recommend giving these a chance, they are a great healthy and quick snack.\n",

      "these are crunchy and very tasty!  these do not taste like the usual chips from the store.  when i first tried them, i could tell right away they were different from the greasy, salty, fatty chips i was used to eating.  these have their own flavor and crunch and i started to appreciate them right away.  i noticed i did not feel so sluggish and icky after eating these.  which was wonderful.  the combo package is great because the flavors are all very different and tasty.  and i love the smaller packages.  they really hit the spot without the risk of overindulging.\n",
      "so good!\n",

      "very tasty chips, healthier alternative to regular chips without compromising on flavor. in fact, the taste is better than most regular chips i have had. would highly recommend this product! if you had to choose, my favorites were the sea salt and vinegar, followed by salt and pepper. ironically, the original flavor was my least favorite, probably because i was spoiled by all the flavor the others offer.\n",
      "loved it!\n",
      "these chips might seem a little expensive compared to other leading and unhealthy i might addchips, but i was not disappointed in my purchase. they arrived in a few days and made the perfect snack for me and my husbands lunches. also, we checked for the closest store selling these and it was target 50 miles away in tulsa and would have been costly to buy them as they are more per case and the drive to get them.\n",
      "worth the money!\n",
      "the reason why i ordered this online is because the only pop chips they have in my store are the regular and salt and vinegar  barbeque.  i love the sour cream and onion ones  actually i love all of them, but it is great to have them in the 100 calorie bag, because if they were not i would not be able to stop eating them.\n",

      "pretty good   but will not buy again\n",
      "despite the plethora of positive product reviews for these snacks, i see no reason to buy them again. read those positive reviews and compare the content in some of them to the guidelines of a nonprofit consumer organization for reviews. they contain a lot of wow! with little specifics that would have been included by a true believer. weigh the others as you will, but the proof is still in the pudding.br br the texture is their best asset if you like that sort of texture; that is about it for me. they appear to be an extruded potato product many of those out there with various seasonings that do not impress me, either. the most basic of them puts 160mg of sodium into the tiny .8oz package. if you were a deer, you might eat them for that alone. the fat is reduced, that much is true. but...br br unless you are ready to trade fat for sodium, it is no deal. but wait... baked kettle chips, in a 1oz serving, up the fat to... 3g, the same as the .8 of the basic flavor. you got .2oz free on that one. the baked kettles possess 135mg sodium, vs. 160. these chips give you 1g fiber in .8 vs. 2 in 1oz of baked kettles. this product loses again.br br the only place you might gain is in carbs 21 for the kettle chips, 15 for these, but remember... you have .2oz extra in the kettles nutrition info... just about a wash.br br and then, topping it all  the cost... 0.92 an oz vs 0.44 for baked kettles in subscription. wow. these wonderful snacks cost 14.72 per pound, packed as they are. the prices will fluctuate... but think about the things you can buy for that money instead. these are microscopic bags that does not help the environment, either  portion control aside with product largely deriving its kick from sodium and cheap spices.br br the most positive thing i can say is the product is packed very well. lots of air in the bags to protect the chips, and they will mostly arrive intact in their tiny portions in tiny bags. you will not have many crumbs in the bottoms of these little bags, so that is a good thing.br br but... bottom line... expensive junk health food. wow!.\n",

      "i will not get into all of the specifics of these chips as they are listed here on amazon. however, i will talk about the product overall. it is very well packaged, the popchips bags are not flimsy or too loud. you do not have to worry much about these getting smashed while they are in a bag with heavier items. they hold their own. when trying new foods, snacks, flavors, i tend to purchase a variety pack so that i can sample everything. let me tell you, these chips are packed with flavor but, it is not, in my opinion, too heavy or saturated. my favorites are the barbecue potato and cheddar potato by far. very realistic, savory flavors. then, there a couple that are not my favorite but, tasty with time. the sea salt and pepper potato and the sea salt and vinegar potato are a bit strong at first and, if you do not like those flavors, i would say you would not like those chips but, they certainly accomplish the taste of those ingredients. original potato and sour cream and onion potato are also tasty but, nothing to necessarily rave about, for me at least. i would not call this a diet chip but, a healthy alternative to over processed chips. i saw a few complaints about the popchips being too salty or high in sodium. the chips can come across salty to a person who does not consume much salt but, per bag, these popchips contain about as much sodium as a cup of plain yogurt. overall, great buy. you just have to decide if the price tag is okay for you, and for me, it is.\n",

      "this chips are really good and it is fun getting the variety pack.  now, are they as good as regular chips?  probably not, but they are also not nearly as fattening and bad for you as regular chips.  given that these are a healthier version if you want chips, i would highly recommend them!\n",

      "love these popchips.  they are all great.  do not care for the salt  pepper flavors.  i wish manufacturer would come up with a variety pack that did not include that flavor as that flavor is just wasted with each purchase i make and i have made alot!.  the bbq, original, salt  vinegar and sour cream  onion chips are superb!\n",

      "not bad\n",
      "these chips arrived in terrible condition. the box they were sent in was a display box with all the usual perforations on the box for display. why someone would send a box like that in the mail and not have put it in another real box is beyond me. the box we received was heavily taped to keep it together since the box came open on the display perforations and looked like someone had driven over the box as well, which gives you an idea of the shape of the box. the chip bags inside were pretty flat, there were no chips, but plenty of crumbs for any use you would need crumbs for. this is how many of the packages looked, flat. there were a few with edible chips, but not many. not sure what to think of shipping chips in this type of a box, common sense should have been used??\n",

      "popchips does it for me\n",
      "these are such a treat when you are craving that salty, crunchy snack. and the multibox where you get a variety of flavors is perfect. share it with son so they do not get stale but not much chance of that.  one of my 3 points plus weight watchers snacks that i do not run out of!\n",
      "snack of the hour!\n",
      "the only flavor we could stand was the barbecue which was the reason we purchased them in the first place!  i had to give the others away!!!  i will not be buying this again for lunches although the sizepackaging was great.  i just wish the other flavors tasted better plain, salt, pepper, etc., were not really kidfriendly.\n",

      "pop chips...yummy!\n",
      "these taste alright, but they are health food by no means. at least regular potato chips are just greasy potato slices. this products is made of processed potato byproduct and is natural by no means. the calorie savings is not even significant enough to give up the better taste of potato chips. also keep in mind that the healthiest part of a potato chip is the oil if eaten in moderation because of the healthy dose of balanced fats. in my opinion if you want a healthy chip eat sun chips or a cracker like triscuits. if you want a potato chip eat a real potato chip. if you feel these taste better than the above, then by all means enjoy, but do not be tricked into believing these are healthy at all.br overall 4 stars for taste and 2 stars for the marketing scam that they are.\n",
      "taste alright, but normal chips are better\n",
      "i have subscribed these chips. they are so tasty. not dry or oily. cannot put it down once open a bag and have to have two bags in a row.\n",
      "love it! so tasty!\n",
      "i love these chips. they are so delicious, it is so hard to eat just one bag. all the flavors allow you to taste them all.  my favorite flavor is the cheese ones. go ahead and try them.  they are so delicious.\n",
      "pop delicious\n",
      "i purchased these because i was hoping for a healthy alternative to chips. well, they are fairly healthy: absolutely no oily residue on the hands and very light and airy. however, i just could not get over the taste, which i can only liken to slightly burnt popcorn. if that undercurrent of burnt flavor was not there, these might have been more palatable, but my taste buds kept zeroing in on that one aspect. also, the seasonings were not consistently strong. cheddar was o.k. bbq was probably the closest match to regular potato chips...the flavor was straight from a bag of lays. however, i was very disappointed with the sour cream and onion which was just too light in flavor and the vinegar and salt which did not have as strong a tang as i would have liked.br br overall, i would recommend these to someone who wanted to eat healthy and did not mind a watered down version of a fried chip. however, i just could not stomach them. i gave away the unopened bags to coworkers none of which were impressed either but they are not on diets...lucky dogs. for now, i will stick with my baked goldfish and bunny crackers.\n",
      "like slightly charred popcorn\n",
      "i found these chips originally at a local market.  however, i have been unable to find them since.  whew!  what a relief when i was able to locate them.  these chips have so much flavor, they are not greasy and they are crunchy.  i am a chipaholic and these are by far the best chips i have ever eaten.\n",
      "yummie!\n",
      "these chips are great. delicious and are healthier than your regular deli store chips. i have first purchased these from a supermarket and found them delicious. i found amazon to have them cheaper, and ordered from them as they had more variety of flavor. all the flavors were to my liking. the only con about this is that they are addicting!!!. you are warned! i purchased these through amazon.\n",
      "delicious!\n",
      "these are the best chips ever. i will buy them again, wish more stores had them.the plain chips are my fav.\n",
      "very good!!\n",
      "these chips taste so dry and gross, i would rather eat carrots or something than these. they just did not satisfy the salty craving and were not worth the calories.\n",
      "overrated\n",
      "i am sort of a health nut who has weened myself off highlypalatable junk food. junk food is delicious but it is not good for you. conversely, healthy food has a bad rep for being disgusting but i honestly think that it is just something that requires training and acclimatization.br br i really like popchips. they do not taste absolutely amazing to be honest but if you are someone who is trying to kick junk food out of your diet, this is a good way to fulfill a craving without succumbing to unhealthier junk foods. each bag is only 100 calories, which is very helpful for portion control.br br for me, the taste is great. it is not amazing but it is not awful. sure there are better tasting chips out there but how much more unhealthier are they?br br i have tried small bags of popchips from the vending machine which i recommend doing before you buy a case. i have not tried all over the flavors until i bought the case and i was a little disappointed with half of the flavors in the box. fortunately, my boyfriend and i disagree on what tastes good so he likes the flavors i do not like and vice versa. it works out great for us and probably will work out great for family situations and parties where people usually do not have the tastes. however, if you plan on consuming these bags on your own over time i can almost guarantee that there will be a couple flavors that you will not like and it might just be worth it if you just buy a couple bags of flavors you do like.br br if you are not accustomed to the taste of healthy food, you might not enjoy these at first. either way, pop chips are worth a try. probably not by the case though. i recommend trying out a few flavors if you can find a small bag at the shop or vending machine before you buy a big box of them.\n",
      "not for everyone.. but i love it!\n",
      "i bought these to try them out and for the most part it was a success. there are 6 different flavors of chips. 5 of them were really good. the last one though was not. the salt and vinegar ones were very vinegary and it was too bitter for our tastes. maybe some people like it but not us. all in all though, they were mostly very good in both taste and caloric content.br i would definitely buy a box with the flavors that i wanted.\n",
      "most flavors are very good\n",
      "this practically falls under the category of healthy snack  well, almost.  single serving bags mean you will not be overeating and the fact that these are not in anyway greasy because of the way they are made is a huge plus.  nice crisp crunch.  the bags are filled with air, which for the most part do a good job of keeping the chips whole.  on the case that i got, though, two bags containted nothing but broken bits.  of the rest most only had a couple of broken chips  some no broken ones at all.  i also noticed that you do not find nearly as much coating from flavoring on your fingers as i have experienced when eating other chips.br br purchasing it by the case to try out all of the flavors is a good idea and a decent value.  some of the flavors are incredibly strong, to the point that i do not like them, so i will not be ordering this mixed case again.  salt and pepper just tasted like pepper, making this a very hot tasting chip.  the seasalt and vinegar is really strong on the vinegar, which is a taste i do not enjoy.  i love bbq flavored chips, but again, this was kind of strong.  i probably would not purchase the bbq ones in the future, but would not say no if someone offered them to me.  the original is really bland compared to these others, but not bad.br br the ones i liked the most were the sour cream  onion and the cheddar, both with milder flavors.br br i would give this 5 stars if i liked all of the flavors.  definitely high marks for the type of chip and the size of the serving and the fact that you can try all of the flavors in one order.\n",
      "great idea\n",
      "yes people, these things are healthier than the average chip and not only have flavor, but they taste good! i am not a big health food person, i will take the grease if it makes it taste better. these are 100x better than those baked chips. my brother tried them while he was visiting and liked them so much it was one of the things he asked i mail him while deployed. only draw back to these chips, they are definitely not for dipping.\n",
      "healthy and good, what?!?!\n",
      "tried the bbq popchips for the first time and loved them so got the value pack to try more flavors. loved them all except the salt and pepper chips which were not that great. good healthy snack without giving up the taste. so glad i discovered these! salt and vinegar are my favorite! 100 calbag, 3.5g fatbag\n",
      "healthy and delicious!\n",

      "cheetos ever since i was kid were one of my favorite snacks,i mean who would not like them? you cannot go wrong with the original but decided to give this one a try. i am not a fan of unbearably hot foods but i do like things with with a kick and since this had jalapeno in it i was assuming it was hot...not so much. if you eat mildly hot foods this should not bother you at all and definitely not if you like hot kind of food. i did not even find them hot just have a unique kick of cheddery jalapeno flavor. i would recommend to buy these at your local store if they carry them because this price on here is just insane, i buy mine for a little over 3 dollars for this bag. overall i hope they decide to keep this one, cause they are amazing. and yes girls like these kind of snacks too :! love!\n",
      "soo good!\n",
      "for you spicy lovers, these jalapentilde;o cheetos are for you. the taste is great and i admit i did not expect them to be this good. one day i picked up a small bag at the corner store and by the end of the week i had about 4 empty bags in my trash cans. office snack a must! unfortunately this product is too good to last and i fear it will meet the same fate as wasabi funyuns. rarely does a spicy type of chip that actually tastes awesome become part of the standard sale roster. so enjoy these awesome jalapentilde;o cheetos for as long as they last.\n",

      "i bought this because i had been seeing this pod in magazines and other places. i thought it would be a great addition to my fridge to save money on cilantro. however, this is very poorly designed. i could not open it whatsorever, even after searching through reviews after reviews. finally, my genius boyfriend found the solution! basically, you will need to open it from the bottom. you will need to squeeze the two sides next to the cap in order to open it. you will have to be careful when you are opening or closing it while there is water in the pot. if any one who is reading this still having problem opening it. let me know. i will try to explain it better there. but anyway, this is a pretty useless product for its productivity, but a bit more useful if you are too lazy to make your own, and wants a prettier fridge. you can make you own with a cup or any container filled with a bit of water and wrapped in plastic bag with the herb....so unless you have money to waste, do not buy this useless pot.\n",
      "found the solution on how to open it\n",
      "this product works great for me.  i hate spending money on herbs just to use a little and have the rest go bad shortly after.  i put some herbs mostly basil in here and they were fresh for a few weeks!  no leakage probs either, the bottom is clearly labeled to twist to lock and the plug stays flush.br this thing has already paid for itself in money saved and looks pretty cool in my fridge and on the counter when i am ready to cook.\n",
      "works for me and saves me \n",
      "i have had my herb savor for a few weeks now, and i was waiting to write a review until my herbs went bad, so i could tell you how long it takes, but it never happened. for the first time ever, i used all of the herbs before they went bad. i have not had any problems with leaking. everything closes up nice and tight on mine. plus, this thing just looks really cool!\n",
      "this thing is great!\n",
      "i bought this as a gift for my mother. she likes it but says it is hard to open. when she unwrapped it i remember having to help her figure out how to open it. it took me a minute. if you have arthritis you will not be able to pry this open!\n",
      "a little hard to open\n",
      "i have had the herb pods for about 6 months.  they are a great concept, but have a poor design. the plastic cover is very hard to take off and snap back on.  i am  constantly afraid that i am going to break it.  the pods do keep herbs fresh for several weeks in the fridge as long as you replace the water.  unfortunately i do not use them half of the time i buys herbs because they are more trouble than they are worth.\n",
      "great concept, poor product\n",
      "with no clear instructions on how to open and close the unit, the first few times are an act of frustration.  when i finally realized that if i grip with my thumb and forefinger over the clear plastic shield, about one third from it is bottom and squeeze the sides, the bottom lip pops out nicely.br i will agree that this size is too small for most popular herbs like parsley, basil ect.  the company does now make a larger unit and it looks like it is more user friendly.br all in all i like it, i took away one star for the lack of instructions.br br 32012: after a few months i have thrown this thing away.  it became increasingly harder to open and the size was just too small for the herbs i use most.  i have seen some newer, larger units that do not have the issue with opening it like this one has...i am going to order one of these.br br i no longer recommend this unit and have lowered it to 2 stars.\n",
      "too small, too hard to open\n",
      "despite reading the reviews of others on how hard this was to open, i was confident i knew the secret so would be fine. not so. no matter what i did, could not pop off the clear plastic lid. instructions showed the bottom part screwing off, did not. husband could not even do it and he opens everything for me. he finally got it open, only held about half of the aspargus which is what i wanted it for so tossed it in the garbage and then bought one from progresso that we both can open. note to self, pay more attention to what people are saying.\n",
      "cannot open\n",
      "the reviews on this are so true. great idea, but such a pain to pop the clear lid off from the side, even once i figured it out. i keep waiting for it to break in my hands because it does take some pressure to pop off the lid  but it feels fragile and likely to break with too much pressure. i would consider buying one of the new designs that seem sturdier and open from the top not the side.\n",
      "great idea, such a pain to open and close\n",
      "i have had trouble storing fresh basil because i learned a long time ago not to put it in the fridge.  my cat is attracted to anything in the plant family with disasterous results.  this keeps my basil fresh and the cat ignores it!\n",
      "keeps basil on the counter...cat proof!\n",
      "i rarely write reviews, but these pods are so awful, i was hoping to save even one person from wasting their money like i did.  the little green plug barely stays in  even after twisting it  so the water is always sloshing out.  and the clear plastic cover is absolutely the worst design.  it is nearly impossible to remove and actually snapped into shards when i tried to open one of the pods.  and i can attest that those plastic shards are sharp!  if you are able to actually open the pod, be prepared for the water to splash out from the bottom.  even if the pods actually worked well and preserved the herbs which they do not really do, they would not be worth the aggravation or cost.  like another reviewer said, just put your herbs in a cup with a little water in the bottom and a plastic bag covering the top.  works perfectly and costs nothing.  please do not waste your money on this!\n",
      "save your money!\n",
      "i have had a couple of these for a few years but find that i do not use them all that often because their size  design limits their usefulness. for bushy herbs like cilantro or parsley it only holds a small bunch, and it is difficult to keep the bunch together while you snap the lid back on. since the bottom cup is so shallow herbs tend to flop out the front unless you lay the pod down when first filling it. it works great for asparagus, but only for smallish bunches and if the spears are not too tall.br br more often than not i simply use a canning jar  12 of water with a plastic bag over the top, which keeps the contents just as fresh and allows for easier access. these pods do look much nicer in the fridge than a bagtoppedjar, however, and the clear front makes it harder to forget what is in there.br br they are definitely well made and not prone to leaking or tipping over. and the little drain port is fun to use.br br but it only works for small bunches.\n",
      "keeps herbs fresh, looks niceawkward to use\n",
      "i got one of these for xmas...and to be honest it does work well and does extend the life of your fresh herbs while providing an attractive container.br br the main problem is the container is difficult to open. it does get easier over time but whoever designed this thing should not have made it so hard from the get go.br br the thing is its very easy to open when there is nothing inside it as you can you use as much force as needed open it you do not need to open the bottom....just squeeze the sides and pull the plastic cover up and out firmly. do not worry...you will not break it. it is pretty sturdy plastic.br br the real issue is when it is filled or has water in it...its difficult to use that much force and popping it open without spilling.br br i have just resorted to emptying the water reservoir through its fill port....then popping it.br br prepara...please read these reviews and improve on the next design!!!\n",
      "would be a great product....if it was easier to open\n",
      "even with the tips shared on how to open it, it is still pretty difficult to open.  i guess i have weak hands. my husband usually has to open it for me, and even he does not do it with ease.  i would recommend getting the larger prepara herb savor instead of the pod.  it is much easier to open and can hold more.  i could hardly fit any cilantro in the pod considering that the grocery sells them in such large bunches and i only use half.\n",
      "works, but hard to open...buy larger version instead of pod\n",
      "saw this on oprahs favorite things and thought it would make a great little christmas gift for my friends that love cooking as much as i do. since they come in packages of three, i kept one and gave two away. i could not open mine to clean it, so my husband had to open it and he had a hard time. i thought it was just too tight from the factory. my basil looked great after ten days. but when i went to use the basil, i could not open the pod. husband not home...neighbor not home...dog missing thumbs. i tried lightly rapping it against the counter edge and the seam cracked right down the middle. okay, maybe a little harder than lightly, i was pretty frustrated. luckily i had emptied the water, so i only had a small mess to clean up. the pod went into the garbage...forcefully. i checked with my friends. friend 1 had the same problem and her pod is now a rooting capsule for plant clippings because she had to throw away the clear cover...it also broke when she squeezed the pod to try to open it. friend 2 has now been warned. there were no special tips included on how to open the pod and judging from comments i have read, we are not the only ones who have had this problem. i think this was designed by the same guy that invented the  security wrappingtape on music cds! i have gone back to my old method...a widemouth mayo jar with pretty hair band holdingdown a circle of fabric...it works!\n",
      "sorry oprah, not one of my favorite things\n",
      "i wanted very much to like this product, but after using it for more than 9 months, i just cannot. the clear plastic cover is very difficult to get off, especially when the pod is filled with water. it is also difficult to get the cover on, especially when you are trying to store bushy herbs like parsley or cilantro. the oring that is supposed to seal the bottom of the pod does not seem to seat correctly. after removing the bottom of the pod to clean out dirt left behind from some rooted herbs, i have never again been able to get it to be watertight. consequently, every time i use my pod,i have to store it in a bowl or else i am mopping up water from my fridge shelf. on the plus side, the leaky bottom helps to remind me to change the water every day!\n",
      "wilted hopes\n",
      "my wife bought me this for storing fresh herbs and despite initial skepticism i gave it a try. it seemed to work well enough for basil, even freshening up some wilted leaves... but the seal the deal moment was when i put some fresh thyme in it and put it in the back of my refrigerator where i mostly forgot about it. 6 weeks later we were gone for 2 weeks on vacation i opened it and the thyme was as fresh as the day it was cut. i doubt it would sustain all greens for this long but the fact that it kept thyme fresh for over a month longer than a plastic bag in the produce drawer would have made this an easy 10 to justify.br br it is always a nice surprise when a kitchen gadget delivers the goods.\n",
      "just works\n",

      "i am a college student who loves to cook and this was given to me about 4 months ago. i am so impressed with its ability to keep my herbs fresh for such a long period of time. it not only gives more options when i am cooking by having fresh herbs available, but also, its easy to clean, and stores easily in my small fridge. i really think this is a must have product for everyone!br br and if interested in a larger one, i attached a link to the company site prepara, where you can see all their cool and innovative products.br br ...\n",

      "caveat emptor! disappointing\n",
      "i threw this away after about a week of ownership.  could not get the clear plastic cover on and off without spilling water all over, and half the time, i could not get it off at all.  it only works for long stemmed herbs, and all need to be about the same height.\n",

      "works great!\n",
      "the prepara herb savor pod is advertised holding asparagus. that was why i purchased it, thinking it would be good for keeping asparagus fresh. in reality the pod will hold very few spears and they would need to be quite thin and short.  the ad is misleading. i will keep it for storing herbs, but asparagus is out of the question.\n",
      "the picture is misleading\n",
      "i got this in my christmas stocking from my stepfather.  we are both foodies, and try to cook like chefs in our homes.  i love this product.  i use this one for scallionsgreen onions which until recently always went bad before i could use all of them.  sometimes i threw out more than 5, most times 2 or 3, but i honestly cannot remember the last time i used every single one.  that is, until now.  inside the savor pod, they grow and keep for weeks easily more than 3.  i am planning on buying the set of mini savor pods so i can actually use them for fresh herbs  storing my herbs in the same container as my onions is not a good idea.  the only drawback with this product is that the clear plastic cover is a little tricky to remove as others have mentioned, but wrestling with it is ok with me so long as i can use all my product before it goes bad.\n",

      "inside of can corroded\n",
      "after reading a previous review i carefully inspected the cans when they arrived. the cans were immaculate and very clean so i felt relieved. after cooling in the fridge i ate the first can. the fruit was very mushy and not attractive to look at and frankly a disapointment but did not taste rotten per say. only minutes later though my mouth felt like acid was eating at it and was very painful for hours even after washing out my mouth. i eat much canned and fresh fruit and this was a first for me. only days later my teeth and gums were infected and i had to go to the dentist for the pain was so bad. he found infection and i had to undergo a treatment of antibiotics and painkillers before i was finally ok again after about 2 weeks. sheesh! needless to say i threw out the remaining cans of fruit! the problem must be at the source as the cans and packaging were 1st rate and shining clean. quality control must really suck. i am all for natural but great care must be taken so contamination is avoided. this is a foreign product and their health standards may be lacking there. i would stay far away from this stuff if you value your health!\n",

      "i had read some favorable reviews of this pancake mix on amazon quite a while ago.  i had never ordered any, but i came across a can of it in one of those outdoor,camping stores last christmas.  i have been using it ever since to make my dieting harder, and can honestly say i have never enjoyed the struggle so much.  pancake mixes are usually one of those things that usually i buy the cheapest i can find, or at least one that i am familiar with.  i tend to balk at higher priced mixes for the most part. but every now and then i get curious of a brand like this one. it just so happens that when i visited this camping store, i was getting ready to take a short hike as soon as the holidays were over, and pancake mix has always been one of my staple items to take along.  unfortunately it was not till i left that i realized that this mix was not one of the just add water ones that we all know and love.  the best ones always needed your own addition of eggs, milk, butter, etc, and this one is no exception in that respect.  so instead of enjoying this mix on the trail, i have been making pancakes in the wilds of my very own kitchen.  i really do not know what it is about this mix that makes it so good, but it does indeed make some of the best and most delicious pancakes i have ever tasted from a mix.  they are very light, fluffy, and flavorful, and well worth the price and ingredients that you have to add yourself.  if you have a pancake fiend in your home, i would highly suggest you buy some of this great mix. its cheaper here on amazon than i paid for it and well worth it in my opinion. i have had lots of different kinds over the years, and this makes some truly delicious pancakes.... highly recommended...\n",

      "i love this pancake mix.  i bought my first can from whole foods market about a year ago.  my only complaint is, for all the work you have to put into making them at least the pancakes anyway you could just as easily make pancakes from scratch.  you have to add your own egg, whole milk, and melted butter.  one thing i have noticed about this mix is that it is relatively difficult to burn the pancakes.  it is, however, easy to overcook them.\n",

      "i used to buy bobs red mill organic 7 grain pancake  waffle, whole grain mix until i saw all these rave reviews about stonewall kitchen farmhouse pancake and waffle mix. i decided to order from amazon and tried it this morning.br br this pancake mix is very fine and powdery. when i made my pancake mix, the mix was all over my kitchen floor. the mix is almost foamy like when it is done mixing. the waffle recipe from the label asks for 2 tbsp. of melted butter, which i never use that much when i use the robs red mill pancake mix. i could only make two perfect 7 round pancakes from it even though it claims the serving should be 34 pancakes. the pancake is indeed fluffy as others claimed in the review. however, i also tasted a lot of chemicals in it. i guess one reason it is so fluffy is a lot of baking soda in the ingredient. looking at the ingredient label did i realize it has more chemicals than other brands. and i do not understand what artificial flavor it has to be added in when this pancake mix is just the normal type with no fancy flavors like cinnamon and apple, etc.br br in short, i am going back to my robs red mill brand, at least i know what i am digesting in my stomach.\n",

      "this mix makes nice pancakes. they smell rich and vanillay, but you do not actually  taste it as strong as it smells. i will not buy them again because there are easier mixes out there that taste pretty darn close. i am just as happy using a krusteaz brand mix that only requires the addition of water no eggs or milk or flour necessary. heck, if you want that vanilla smell and taste, add an eighth or quarter teaspoon of some extract to your batter.br br edited for grammars sake.\n",
      "nice pancakes, but not as simple as just add water mix.\n",
      "recently, my life partner was complaining about our same ole breakfast every morning.  that is when i discovered that he loves pancakes. i was aware that he liked waffles. we have only been together almost five years!  i, on the other hand, have never cared for pancakes.  i loved my grams waffles, but nothing she did could tempt me to eat pancakes, no amount of butter or slathering with strawberry jam could make a difference. i just did not care for pancakes!  she did insist on teaching me how to make and cook them, because my daddy enjoyed pancakes, so i learned.br i was in central market on saturday when i ran into a coworker and her husband.  they took me by the hand from the baking products isle to the jams, jelly, syrup, honey isle.  on the top shelf was the very best pancake mix:  stonewall kitchen farmhouse pancake and waffle mix. i saw the price and took a deep breath, it was twice the price of the mix i had just been contemplating purchasing. on their recommendation, i tossed it in the cart along with some real organic, light amber, maple syrup.br this morning, i fixed three small 3 inch diameter pancakes for my man and one for myself just to taste. i needed to know!br well, i do not believe i have ever had real maple syrup before in my life, just that sugar processed krapola sold as pancake syrup. i have never liked that stuff!br that pancake with a tiny dribble of real maple syrup was delicious! it was the pancake mix that made the difference.br now i am reading reviews to purchase a waffle maker.  after tasting that light, fluffy pancake, i can hardly wait to have some waffles made from this mix.  these reviews are making my mouth water with anticipation!br i will never buy any thing else.\n",
      "delicious!  very yummy\n",
      "this mix produced some pretty bland pancakes.  followed the directions on the canister and the batter was pretty thin which in turn produced some pretty thin pancakes.  considering the ingredients that needed to be added, it would have been just as easy to create my own buttermilk pancakes from scratch.  i debating trying to figure out how to jazz up the remaining canisters i have left maybe some pumpkin pie spice but that will not help the thicken up the batter.\n",
      "not sure what the hype is ...\n",
      "i am not sure why, but this is our favorite pancake  waffle mix.  just tastes the best to us.\n",
      "our favorite pancake mix\n",

      "not too impressed\n",
      "we did not care for this product at all. it seemed to have a funny after taste to it. was not worth the cost. we were unable to even finish using what we purchased it was that nasty.\n",
      "price versus taste do not add up\n",
      "what am i missing?br br this mix creates a pretty much tasteless pancake. i have tried adding vanilla and cinnamon. i use real maple syrup on top. i cook them in fresh bacon grease. the pancakes are still, just, blah. it is like they absorb and negate the flavors.br br the pancakes cook ok. the texture is fine. just absolutely no flavor.br br will not get this again. considering pitching the rest of what i have.\n",
      "confused...\n",
      "i bought the mix at the same time as the oster 3874 waffle maker and have been pleased with the results: light, well baked waffles that tasted good.  my problems with the mix were first the expense, secondly that the mix is very finely ground and flies around when poured and there may some sort of perfume added to it.  it simply smells too good.br br i am happy with the product but will probably not reorder it.\n",
      "good, reliable results, expensive\n",

      "extremely disappointing\n",
      "we definately got a nice assortment of kcups but were really looking forward to trying the peach tea which was not included in our shipment. i overlooked the line stating some flavors may be substituted but one of our substitutions was a hot coffee mix of eggnog, french toast, and a third winter type flavor. slightly misleading from what is pictured.\n",
      "not all summer?\n",
      "do not get me wrong, i wanted to try the holiday sampler mostly coffee but i ordered the summer sampler with teas.  there were just a couple peach teas, sweet teas, and unsweetened black teas.  i did not send it back because i wanted to try the holiday sampler.  almost everything i got was the eggnog coffee, apple ciders, ginger bread coffee, and french toast coffee.  the box was labeled summer sampler, so i am sure that this was an accident.  i did not contact the seller because i ordered it while i was gearing up for finals and now there is no contact seller button.  so seller, if you see this review message me and we can talk.\n",

      "we love these baby food things in a little pouch. sooooo much easier to feed to a baby or toddler on the go. our son loves sucking the fruit out and we are pleased that it is both organic and healthy with nothing added  just fruit. for smaller ones, not good to let them handle it themselves, because they love to squeeze it, which gets things everywhere. but older ones can feed to themselves. i like the 3.17 size rather than the bigger one that plum organics has for some of the other flavors. it assures that he will eat all or most of it in one sitting rather than having to save some for later. you can also take this size on airplanes without having to have it tested for explosives  not the case with the bigger pouches. i also like that it is bpa free. if your little one likes them, ordering in bulk and with subscribe and save makes them much cheaper than at the store.\n",

      "with the departure of starbucks coffees, i reluctantly switched back to the other tdiscs carried by local stores. i tried, i really did. but, it seemed like every other one i tried, which was basically every other one made, including the european tdiscs, were not rich enough to satisfy me. i finally gave up and went back to an old fashioned drip coffeemaker so that i could make a nice, rich cup. i was still frustrated by the waste, since i am the only coffee drinker in my home. plus, being a basically lazy person, i did not enjoy filling the reservoir every time i wanted to brew a pot, washing the pot out afterwards, or cleaning out the grounds from the filter.recently, tassimogevalia came out with a dark house blend. the front of the package noted: new! if you like starbucks house blend, try this! as a last shot attempt before packing up my tassimo for storage, i purchased this new tdisc coffee. tasting my first sip, i was so happy. really really happy! my coffee is so important to me, and the gevalia dark house blend is amazing!!!! it is a rich, full bodied cup of coffee, and as i drink this day after day, i am starting to think it is even better than my old favorite starbucks flavors. it is as bold as starbucks with no bitterness at all. i would love to hear what others think of this. i am very pleased with it, and i am so glad that i am able to go back to the simplicity of using my tassimo brewer, because they make a great tdisc again!\n",

      "i have a now 8 month old male shih tzu.  when i brought him home from the breeder, i kept him on the pro plan puppy tiny dry kibble until the bag was almost finished.  there was about 2 cups left in the bag and he began walking away from his bowl as soon as i put it down.  as a test, i rolled a few morsels across the tile floor in the kitchen to see what would happen...he would eat about 10 pieces and go bring me one of his squeaker toys to play with. which i was happy with, as i do not want to play with his food as a game to get him to eat.  i went and got him blue buffalo dry puppy food lamb and oatmeal formula, which had bigger size kibbles.  it seemed that he liked the bigger sized items to chew on and the harder antioxidant bits, since he was teething and chewing on his dentabones, venison antler, lamb lung chips for comfort.  again when i got down to about a quarter of food left in the bag, he would walk away from the bowlthis went on for almost 3 days.  he was still having small bowel movements, urinating, drinking water and playing, running and continuing his successful training exercises; called the vet and they wanted to give me wet venison formula by science dietveterinarians diet after the exam, which showed nothing physically wrong.  the one vet tech said that shih tzus tend to be picky eaters.  i did not pick up the food at their check out counter, left and began some of my own research into the breed itself and a more natural diet.  i know from some of our outdoor excursions that he is attracted to road kill he will sniff the air, and want to lunge for it and would probably eat it if left to his own devices...but i will not allow it.  i remember being a kid in the late 60s early 70s and all my friends who had dogs fed them 1 of 2 choices available back then: gravy train or alpo and they mixed meat or the drippings from the meat; they ate bones, etc and all lived into their late teens.  one of my friends small mutt lived to be 24 years old!!!  i never saw these dogs itching or digging at themselves other than the usual ears or if their was a flea problem, since i grew up in a rural area and most often that was a common occurrance.  well, i read up on the more natural diets and decided to get the sojos and ground beef and some boneless chicken thighsbreasts.  my weston is not a big fan of totally raw meat, but when browned i put it in the toaster oven and add 14 tsp of missing link to the meat portion with the soaked sojos original, he eats with gusto!!!  from his early days, i would play with and take his food away, so he is not food aggressive.  he eats the recommended portion for his size and walks away when done.  weston then wants to play hard, train hard, take a nice walk and nap.  his coat is soft and easy to keep brushed and groomed.  the droppings are nice sized and easy to clean up.  i just had him neutered 2 days ago and he ate this sojos mix with the same gusto even with the ecollar to challenge him.  so i am a fan and we are finished with the second 2.5 lb bag and i just ordered another one.  hope this helps someone with a picky eater; i know another reviewer mentioned their shih tzu not liking it, but this shows you that dogs have certain tastes different from each other, much like us humans.\n",

      "when i first started to use iams savory sauce, my dogs loved it. after a few weeks, they do not seem to care too much for it anymore. they still get a little drizzle in their kibble every once in a while, and will eventually eat it when they are hungry, but they do not consider it to be a treat anymore. i still buy it once in a blue moon when it is on sale because of it contains vitamins and its decently priced, and low calorie. one big negative i have noticed about it is that their face is getting dirty from it. they are white dogs and this product tends to cause increased tear and aroundthemouth stains. i used to buy all different flavors of iams savory sauce, buy my groomer told me the chicken flavor is best as the beef and pork based flavors can cause an even worse increase in face staining. vitagravy is a similar product that contains more vitamins, so if your must have some sort of gravy, i recommend vitagravy a bit more. or you can also just mix in some warm water with your dog food and let it sit for a bit before you feed it to your dog. this creates a gravy like texture and aroma that most dogs love. not the greatest idea if your dog has dental issues, but a great free solution for picky eaters.\n",

      "as i get older and fatter, i seek opportunities to eat snacks that at least make a nominal attempt to be healthy.  oreo cookies fail to reach very high on my list of healthy foods.  however, oreo cookies are delicious beyond belief.  not only are oreo cookies delicious, but i sometimes think i hear oreo cookies calling my name as i walk by them.  honest.  i am unable to buy oreo cookies because if i do i know i will eat them; generally in a few days.  not a good idea.br br nabisco, realizing that many of us are making some nominal attempt at eating more healthy foods, have created a brandidentified snack eliminates all the bad fats and most of the fat, creating a yummy and crunchy chocolate wafer snack that is like a chocolate cracker.  to this point no one has ever created a truly healthy snack that is like a cookie.  however, this wafer snack, which nabisco has decided not to call a cookie, perhaps because cookie sounds fattening, is reasonably yummy.  i have eaten these things several times and still eat them.  i actually eat them more than regular oreos, which i count as quite a nod to health.br br you may be tempted to add icing to this baked cookie.  if you are going to add the fat and calories in icing, perhaps you should just skip in pretense at reducing calories and fat and go straight to regular oreo cookies.  in fact, just revel in the calories and go for the double stuff oreos.br br oreos have been around since 1912, and remain the bestselling cookie brand in history.  according to our friends at kraft, which owns nabisco, and which is owned by the altria group renamed from philip morris, presumably for marketing reasons, more then 450 billion oreo cookies were sold in the first 90 years of their existence.  though oreo thin crisps fall quite a bit short of the real thing, they are high quality and have sufficient flavor that allows these baked chocolate wafers to have the oreo name.br br of course, you could just stick with rabbit food and be truly healthy, but where is the fun in that?  for those of us that find a constant diet of veggies to be just too healthy to be fun, and yet the thought of pigging out on a pound of oreos smacks of chunks of fat floating through our circulatory system, oreo thin crisps are a lovely alternative.  or course, you probably should avoid eating pounds of these, even with the reduced fat.  food is food and too much low fat food still is not good for you, even if it tastes good.  at least oreo thin crisps do not talk to me when i walk by.br br enjoy!\n",

      "we are still six years away from the centennial for the oreo cookie, which was first manufactured by nabisco in 1912 as something more exciting for people to dip in their tea than the biscuits the english tend to use it was copyrighted as the oreo biscuit.  the sandwich cookie was quite similar to the hydrox cookie produced by sunshine, but oreo dominated the market to such an extent that they stopped making hydrox back in 1996. what would be considered the modern oreo cookie was developed in 1952 originally they were mound shaped, which is why some think the name comes from the greek word for hill, with the two circular chocolate wafers with the sweet white filling commonly called the cream in between.br br of course today consumers do not have to restrict themselves to just the tradition oreo cookie.  there are oreos with chocolateflavored cream instead of the traditional white, as well as orange colored cream at halloween and red at christmas.  you can get oreos with a double portion of filling, not to mention mixing and matching two flavors of filling carmel and chocolate, coffee and cream, peanut butter and chocolate, etc..  you want the original cookie with a coating of chocolate fudge?  they have that, or with white chocolate fudge in winter, and then there is the uhoh! oreo with the flavors of the cookie reversed.br br but what if you are interested in watching your weight because once you open a bag of which ever type of oreos are your personal preference they are just sitting them beginning to be eating?  after all, once they are open they could go stale, and putting them in a cookie jar just makes them more accessible even if it allays fears about freshness.  nabisco has taken a threeprong approach for weight watching oreo lovers.  you can go with the reduced fat oreo, which is identical to the size of the original but has less fat per serving.  then there are the mini oreos, bitesized versions packaged in snack packs rather than in really think wrapped trays.  now we can add to that short list the oreo thin crisps.br br these are baked chocolate sixsided wafer snacks, almost 20 to a pack, that are lightly sprinkled with white specks that are to take the place of the aforementioned cream.  now, i am someone who likes the cream more than the wafer, so i was wary because i thought scarffing down a bunch of these would be like eating the chocolate wafers without the white cream, but they are lighter in taste than that, even without having the glass of milk handy that i considered essentially when eating the more traditional oreo cookies.  since they do have the oreo taste i can round up on these.  these come in 100 calorie packs, to help you draw the line at a nice round number when it comes to caloric intake.  you can six 0.81 oz 23g packs in a 4.86 oz box.  each pack contains 0 grams of transfat, 2 grams of fat, and 0 milligrams of cholesterol.  you will also find one of 100 healthy living tips on the front of the pack e.g., 56: make a meal out of appetizers or side dishes instead of larger main entrees.  of course, i was thinking of putting some of these in a bowl of vanilla ice cream, but that would really mess up the whole healthy living bit.\n",

      "first thoughts: brings back old memoriesbr br when i recently tried these little wafers i recalled when i worked in an office nearly 20 years ago. whenever the director skipped lunch, he ran all through the department pleading with all the ladies to pull something out of their handbags or desks that might get him through till 5 of the clock. he usually ended up with a couple of packaged saltines which had long since turned stale and were mostly crumbled from being crushed at the bottom of a handbag or desk drawer. i came to realize that some of the girls kept stale crackers just for him  i guess they really admired him. these nabisco oreo thin crisps, baked chocolate wafer snacks would have served his purposes much better than the saltines, but i would rather he have more of his old favorites.br br in a nutshell: nice for a dieter at coffee break time  but no cream  sugar pleasebr br basically, this is a minimalist snack for people who have to eat something inbetween meals and they do not want it to be a 600 calorie confection. that is why the biggest print on the label says, 100 calorie packs  4.5 inches across!br br what is this stuff all about: enriched flour  sugar  artificial flavors  artificial colors  a little canola oilbr br 2 grams of fat  9 grams of sugar in a 23 gram package  100 caloriesbr br bottom line: no pretenses  simple lean sugar wafer with the usual additivesbr br as diet snacks go this is okay stuff to carry with you. one can avoid more calorie dense alternatives with these wafers on hand, making them a sort of antidote or vaccine against dropping energy and bloodsugar levels in the late afternoon which may lead to a large unplanned snack. for that purpose this is a great product and i know that our director, 20 years ago, would have given anything to have these modest wafers available instead of the usual stale saltines that he subsisted on for many a long afternoon. when the director did not find any saltines around the office he would head straight for mcdonalds and the rest was history.\n",

      "this review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. i do not really care as long as people find out what is real and can avoid my mistakes.br br i got my wonderful little sweet bella bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. she had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. i have had cats around me my entire life, for about twentyfive years now. my mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket  friskies, nine lives, kit  kaboodle, stuff like that. and our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. they would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.br br my housemate at the time was working for hills and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. i now know that she is an utter buffoon, but i initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she does not think. she also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.br br i first tried feeding the little bean an unmeasured amount of science diet in a bowl, but that did not work, as she would devour it in one sitting. so then i took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. then i started parsing it out to twice a day. that did not work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. so then i split it into three servings. same thing. then it got to be four servings. that was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. so then it went back to three. all the while, i was trying to reduce the amount of food i was feeding her to less than 34 of a cup because she was a little chubby. reducing was hell. she became even more hungry, but i figured she would get used to it. not really.br br for over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. as soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.br br we thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. she always wanted food. it was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.br br a few weeks back, we took her to a new good, nonmoney factory vet for her second checkup since i have had her. i talked with him about her being always hungry. he asked what she ate, and i told him the adult indoor science diet. without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and i should look for something else. he said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. science diet does, in a very loose, byproduct kind of way  ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it healthy, instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. not that i care about spending money on the bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.br br so we began transitioning her onto wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. she is still eating 50 percent science diet with 50 percent wellness you really should not just give a cat different food one day out of the blue but she never freaks out anymore. it is amazing. and it is 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts i still regrettable have to feed her. we have her down to eating twice a day, only 13 cup in total. she was eating three times a day, 58 of a cup in total. now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. no more knocking things over, no more trashing dads papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. it is incredible.br br i feel so bad that i was doing this to her for so long. we really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. but no, she was genuinely hungry because she was not eating any real food.br br do your cat a favor  buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat  wellness, halo, innova, evo, whatever. figure it out for yourself, but please do not feed your cat this. it is garbage.\n",

      "i love portable electric corrals.  they are a fantastic option for containing horses while camping, etc.  they are easy to use, give your horse some walking around room,  do not require a level setup area, are flexible for sizeshape, and are  small enough to keep handy in your trailers tack room.  i much prefer using these to portable panels, highlining, tying to the trailer, etc.br br there are many portable corral kits on the market, all very similar with the same kinds of components.  except the zareba ezee, which is a different animal.  so i will give you a componentbycomponent rundown on the items in this kit.br br charger  this kit comes with a charger that takes 2 d batteries.  i was leery of this, having had lessthanstellar performance from a 2d charger in the past.  but this one works pretty good, producing a reasonable strength zap with 100 feet of electric tape with good grounding in damp, solid soil.  if your horse is already accustomed to and respectful of electric fencing, this should be sufficient.  the charger is easy to use, with the fence and ground terminals clearly marked.  the onoff switch is very accessible, and a light and an audible sound tell you when it is on.br br electric tape   this kit is advertised as coming with 200 feet of ½ tape.  my kit had only 100 feet.  100 feet is enough for one horse.  i do not know where they are coming with up the statement perfect for containing 45 horses for short periods of time.  no way, not even close, even if i had received the full 200 feet.  of course, it is easy enough to pick up more electric tape at the farm store.  but beware that the more tape you add on, the less zap you will get from your charger.  so i am not sure if the 2d charger would be strong enough with 200 feet of tape.  the tape in this kit comes with a handle preinstalled.  it is a nice handle with a good feel to it, but it does not connect nicely to the posts.  i rigged up an extra little tape loop to hook the  handle to.br br stepin posts  these are my favorite kind of stepin posts.  each post has numerous clips to slide the tape through, so you can set at the right height.  it is very quick and easy to insert and remove the tape from the clips, making setup and takedown easier.br br corner guy lines  this kit comes with some very nice corner guy lines and metal bracing stakes.  honestly, i will probably never use them.  with this style of fence, there usually is not much if any tension on the posts, so  i have needed corner guy lines.  why add to setup and takedown time?  but if you prefer to use the corner guy lines, i think you will like the ones in this kit.  they are nice quality adjustable lines, with metal stakes.br br wires, ground rod, etc  of course this kit contains the necessary wires to connect the charger to the fence, and the charger to ground.  the ground rod is a 12 pointed spike.  nothing special here.br br carrying bag  oh my gosh, a for this carrying bag!  the bag has one long skinny section for the posts, and a separate snapoff zipper tote for the other components.  within the smaller bag, there  are separate compartments and elastic holders for each piece.  no more jumble of stuff!!!  i love it.  one quibble  one of the stepin posts had pierced the bag during packing or shipping.  the bag is made of pretty heavyduty fabric, but not quite heavyduty enough to stand up to a pointed spike.  and the ends of the bag are not reinforced to avoid this problem.br br all in all, this portable fence kit is about as good as any i have seen and would be a reasonable choice for anyone wanting a camping corral.  just do not expect it to contain 45 horses , unless you are rotating those horses in and out one at a time.\n",
      "very good corral for 1 horse, maybe 2 with additional electric tape\n",
      "although i think this pen is great...i did not receive the entire roll of polytape..even after calling customer service...and i think the height of the posts is misleading..hence the 3 stars.  if i wanted to buy a new energizer and more polytape then it would be great to own, as my review below states:br br easy onepage instructions and everything fits nicely back inside the bag, without struggling...br br i needed this portable paddock for my goats because i have a lot of unfenced acreage beyond the barn area.  i was worried about the fence being suitable for goats so i called customer service...the rep went to a lot of trouble and checked this for me and said it would work fine for goats as well.  however, several days later, i called back and spoke to another rep and he said that goats needed much higher voltage.  this particular energizer is 3,000 volts and that goats needed 5,000 to 8,000 volts. but he said i could just buy another pulse type energizer and it would work with the tape that i have.  i have older, very mellow goats so the 3,000 volts are working so far.br br i have different breeds and therefore different heights of goats and one concern was that the clips on the post would not be low enough to the ground for my mixed breed goats but on the post, it has clips all the way down so that the tape can be hung at various heights.  however, even though the post is listed as 4ft high, i measured and they are actually 47 18  inches tall and after you push the metal tip into the ground, you are left with a height of 38 inches.  the tape rests at the bottom of the top clip which holds the tape at 35 inches off the ground.  seems awfully short for horses but i do not know anything about horses either.br br the instructions are clear and has helpful diagrams, making it all very easy to put together.  i did have problems at the end tying it to the last post.  i had to call customer service, and the rep said that you cannot unroll the whole spool of polytape if you are hanging it to the last post via the spool, which is per the instructions.  since i had already unrolled it to the end, i had to tie the end of the polytape to the post or to the empty spool container, which he said was okay, but then it is not easy to untie that knot.br br in lieu of posts, you can hang the guy wire around trees and then slide the electric tape through the loop.  guy wires, which are similar to tent stakes give the posts extra stability, but i saw no need for them at all since the clay soil held the posts very well.br br my ground is hard clay but the fence posts sunk in easily, despite that.  it had rained within the last week though so it may be different depending on the dryness of the soil.  the posts are sturdy, and strong enough to not break with normal use.  i did have gravel in some spots which made me have to relocate a few posts, since the tips would not go past them.br br there is no mention of the tape being allowed to touch weeds and grass, so i called customer service back to find that out. he said that that only a low impedance energizer can be used near grass and this energizer is not low impedance.  so, i had to mow where i wanted to put the fence to avoid any problems with grounding.  not very practical when out on the road.br br planning the fence was harder than i imagined because i could not make a perfect square and i thought i had measured correctly but still fell short of where i wanted the fence to end.  i then discovered that i was only given 126 feet of polytape rather than the 200 feet.  doing a trial run of setting the fence up is recommended.br br i wanted something that was easy.  i am a small middleaged female and needed something that was not too much trouble so i could move it around without a lot of sweat and tears.  this is perfect for my goat situation if they had just sent me the correct length tape.  it seems too short for horses but i posted the measurements in case it helped someone who has horses.\n",

      "this kit pulls together several standard components rather nicely. i am using it for supplemental grazing of horses, particularly to get small areas that are not permanently enclosed as pasture, but that get overgrown andor delicious.br br i like it. setup time, once you figure out the components, is about 15 minutes. it has all the pieces to make a very reasonable temporary electric corral  tape, posts, charger, ground, and gate hook.br br the 8 stepin posts are fairly standard: they have nice pointy metal stakes at the bottom that make them relatively easy to insert in moist ground. you probably cannot get them into rock hard dry ground, but that is not a surprise. there are clips to give you flexibility in the fence height. but  you have probably seen them at the feed store  this kind of post is pretty short and will feel quite short compared to a normal horse fence.br br the kit is supposed to come with 200 of 12 electric tape. mine as a vine kit only had 100. this is enough for one very well behaved horse in a 25x25 square. the tape is not much of a visual barrier, especially with only one strand. this is not a fence i would trust for a problem horse or for long unattended periods. 200 would be enough for either two strands or to have a 50x50 square and would be a much better value of time spent to grazing time. 50 x 50 is still quite small and the fence is still not substantial. it would be straightforward to add tape, but adding distance also increases the load on the charger.br br the product description says 45 horses. i would not feel safe doing that. two quiet horses who know each other well and are already familiar with electric fence, maybe three for very brief periods, if you had the 50 x 50 and were nearby or had a secure outer fence. for grazing, three horses would have the area mowed in just a couple of hours.br br the charger  which uses 2 d batteries  has plenty of zap new. i was pleased by how easy it was to work with. it has its own spike, allowing you to set it up away from the fence.  the connections are long enough that you can put it out of nose range. the grounding nail was easy to set up and pull out.br br i like that it comes with a simple corner bracing system. you can set it up without the corner braces, depending upon how tight you like your fence and how stiff the ground is. but when you need the braces, you are glad to have the option.br br the tape comes on a handy small spinning jenny, which is designed to hang on the fence when it is installed. it is a simple thing, and thoughtfully done. it makes it easy to unroll the fence when setting up, and easy to reroll when putting it away. there is no problem doing the whole setup and takedown by yourself.br br the hook for the gate is not quite a match for the brackets on the posts. a little bigger hook, or some sort of metal bracket, would be nice, to give a sense of a more secure latch. still, you are counting on the fence never being touched, so it is not a big problem.br br the bag for the kit is amazing. everything fits inside beautifully, with thoughtful pockets  even a special pocket for the instructions. it is easy to carry and extremely organized. i was very impressed to see the thought and effort put into the bag, which makes the kit much easier to use and deal with than just a pile of fence parts. the bag is big enough that there is room for extra items in both the long post compartment and the smaller bag section.br br this is a very nice and handy kit to have around if you have quiet horses that respect electric fence.\n",

      "i have not owned a portable fence for horses until now, but i am impressed and liking this product very much. upon opening the package i was happy with the portability of the carrying bag, and shocked at how lightweight and compact this system is. it is a great accessory to throw in the trailer when taking the horses out, or just to have around in the event that we need a temporary corral for a couple horses. once set up, it will not hold more than two of our horses comfortably. i do not think we would ever try and manage to get 4 inside like the product advertises!br br the instructions were surprisingly simple and it set up easily between myself and my husband working on it. i can see how this would be great to have for other animals as well such as alpacas, but we only have need for it with the horses and have had success in containing them.  the step in posts are fantastically designed, the overall design makes the fence very versatile, setting up easily pretty much anywhere your horse an go.br br we are very happy with it is design and portability and will get a lot of good use out of this system, i think!\n",
      "easy setup, nice design\n",
      "i am always impressed when someone tries to solve an old problem in a new way. and i have never been happy hobbling my horse  i would rather she could escape from a dangerous situation, and something unpredictable is far more likely to happen on the trail than at home. sooo  here we have this device that is compact and weighs only 15 pounds, thus is easy to pack for trail rides. and since it operates on easilyobtainable d cells, no problem being off the grid.br br the fishock hc100 portable paddock showed up in a nice durable red cordura nylon case. the long part contains eight molded, reinforced plastic stakes with foot push tabs to make it easy to get the metal spikes at the bottom, into the ground. their working height seems to be just about 3 feet. multiple slots allow a variety of configurations in setup.br br a smaller bag attaches to the pole bag with snaps. it contains 100 of conductive tape on a reel no, i do not know why the product description says 200, the transformer of nicely molded, durablelooking green plastic, a transformer stand to be tamped into the ground, a shoulder strap, and two d cell batteries which i promptly put in a safer place so they could not accidentally contact conductive material and discharge.br br this proved easy enough to set up in an area that is clear of tall brush that could cause trouble when contacting the live tape. properly set up, the paddocks batteries did not drain. of course i carried extras. i also chose to guy the corners which i am used to with tents. of course i had to bring extra rope and tent stakes for that purpose. no problem.br br this worked... for one nothuge horse who is trained to electric fences, so she does not challenge them. sure, any beast of her size could easily break out, but i would want her to if in danger. no, i cannot see how the stated 4 or 5 horses could be contained in this enclosure. but this a viable solution on the trail, for my mare.\n",
      "works for us\n",
      "got this to take along on backpacking trips with the horses.  it works fine for that purpose, the size is perfect and worked like a charm.  the two horses did not attempt a getaway, at least.br br easy to put up and easy to take down, along with the portability makes this a camping winner!\n",

      "it is very easy to set up.\n",

      "delicious, but.....\n",
      "i really liked these cookies when they first came out.  but then i got a little tired of them.  they have a bit of a gritty texture, and they do not taste the way you hope they will when thinking of an oreo.  they are worth eating if you have a bad craving, but i cannot eat more than one or two.  the different taste gets to me.  there may be an ingredient in them that does not agree with me.  they contain vegetable oils, just like oreos do.  palm oil is in practically everything these days because it is cheap for companies to use.  when i eat it, it leaves a thick, greasy film in my mouth and throat.  storemade cake frostings, cookies, cupcakes...anything that has it leaves that feeling, and i do not like it at all.  some are worse than others, making it hard to swallow.  this happened when i ate a doublestuf chocolate whonu cookie.  palm oil is listed as an ingredient.  i stopped buying them and the regular chocolate.  i only get the vanilla version.  they contain palm oil as well, but i am guessing it is less because they do not bother me.  i like them much better.  it is weird because i like chocolate sandwich cookies better than vanilla ones in general.  but with whonu, the vanilla wins for me.br br yesterday i had a craving for a chocolate sandwich cookie, and i bought oreos.  even oreos do not taste as good as they used to.  i guess since the trans fat change in products.  the whonu cookies have the extra vitamins and nutrients, and less sodium.  but the oreos have a better flavor.  the difference in fat content does not seem to be very different.  actually, the difference in sodium does not seem very significant, either.  i decided i would rather eat a few oreos than a few of these.  it is something you have to decide for yourself when comparing the pros and cons.\n",
      "okay\n",
      "this review is based on taste only, not nutritional value or any of the other qualities or selling points of these cookies.  i wrote three sort of similar reviews for this brand of cookies.  this review is for those who are looking for a cookie because they want a cookie, not vitamins or fiber or whatever.  i bought them because i have a sweet tooth and wanted some cookies and these were on sale plus i had a coupon.  i purchased the crispy cookies, the vanilla sandwich cookies and the chocolate sandwich cookies.  i thought they were all very good and would not hesitate to buy them again. i found these cookies to taste very good, very similar to an oreo except that the cookie part was a little thinner and crispier than an oreo.  oreos might taste a wee bit better but then they are oreos, come on.  a cool fact i found out when i was looking up ingredients for whonu chocolate sandwich cookies and oreos, the first ingredient in regular oreos is sugar and in these cookies and most other sandwich cookies i think it is flour.  i found that interesting for some reason.  anyway, out of the three flavors i tried this was my least favorite but only because i like vanilla alot, these are still great tasting chocolate sandwich cookies!\n",
      "really good cookies!\n",
      "these are grossly overpriced.  it is a package of three boxes but when you take into account that they are a dollar of two per box than they should be, you then have to pay for shipping.  sorry, i would skip them.  my local grocery store carries them and a box is anywhere from 2.98 to 3.49 each.  although these are healthier than some other cookies, you still have to watch the fat, sugar and salt contents.  whole foods are much better for you but in a moment or two of indulging, these fit the bill.  just the price on this site is ridiculous!  ask your grocer to start carrying them.\n",

      "better than the others, but still not quite there\n",
      "i hate sucralose.br br honestly, i do not know how other people cannot taste it when it is in sweetened products. it is got this unpleasant fake flavor that i just cannot ignore. i think any company that uses that junk should be required by law to indicate it on their box and all advertising.br br that being said, it seems like this hot cocoa has less sucralose than the cafe escapes hot cocoa, and as such i have to give it higher marks than the competition.br br still, i cannot believe this product and its nearest competitor use sucralose but do not say they are a diet, lite, lowsugar, or otherwise unnaturallysweetened product. it is frustrating. i can taste the stuff, and i really dislike it. i also do not like the chemical makeup of sucralose, but i will not go into that here just believe me: natural sugar is way better for you in the long run.br br there is one other choice out there for a hot cocoa in a kcup, and that is swiss miss. unfortunately, the swiss miss kcups are ridiculously high priced and hard to find.br br my opinion? it is probably better if you just get your favorite hot cocoa in packets, and use the hot water function of your keurig. it is not worth the kcup convenience if you have to put up with artificial sweeteners or significantly higher prices. spending more than seventyfive cents per cup of waterbased hot cocoa is about the limit for me.br br so, if you are into sucralosesplenda, then by all means grab this and enjoy that weird aftertaste and decidedly notsugar flavor. if you are like me, though, and cannot stand that artificial stuff, then avoid this product and find another option.br br three stars for tasting decent despite the awful artificial sweetener. minus two stars for being artificially sweetened and not mentioning it anywhere.br br update:  i just found out that the swiss miss kcups also use sucralose. so really, your only choice is to get packets and use your keurig as a hot water dispenser. how disappointing.br br update 0212: after some research, i found that there is one kcup hot cocoa that does not have sucralose; however, it is loaded with fructose instead not the greatest tradeoff, since it tastes different from sugarsucrose, in my opinion and has no actual sugarsucrose in it. that one is green mountain coffee hot cocoa. unfortunately, reviews of it say it has a strong coconut flavor probably because the second ingredient is coconut oil and is on the salty side, so i have avoided it. it is also more expensive percup, and unless you think a single cup of cocoa is worth over a dollar and twentyfive cents as opposed to a box of 12 packets being around two dollars then go ahead and try it. i will refrain at this point and stick to using packets.br br i would also like to clarify again that despite what some comments say, the cafe escapes hot cocoa kcups, swiss miss hot cocoa kcups, and grove square hot cocoa kcups all use sucralose. yes, there is sugar in some of those, but it is in addition to sucralosesplenda, and not by itself.br br so your choices right now are pure sucralose, sucralose plus a sugar, or pure fructose. none of them is appetizing to me, and all of them make the cost per cup of cocoa quite unpleasant.br br 43 servings of sugarsweetened cocoa in a canister will run you around six bucks, and it is no more complicated than a kcup if you know how to operate a spoon.\n",

      "i have read some really funny reviews about this product.  some complain that there is noting left in the pod after it has filled the cup, so therefore it must have been an instant mix!  brilliant deduction, sherlock!  what did you expect...to see chocogrounds in the cup?  yes, it is no doubt cheaper to go some other route, that is why 4 instead of 5 stars.br br but the taste is what you want to know about, right?  the dark chocolate flavor is fairly robust with little grittyness to it.  plop a marshmallow in the cup before brewing and you will have a real treat!  it comes out strong enough on either the 6 oz or 10 oz setting of the brewer.  not surprisingly, the milk chocolate flavor is not as strong and a little smoother.  marshmallow trick has a little different effect making the milk chocolate not only creamier and smoother but a little dilute too.  so, maybe a few minimarshmallows instead of a fullsized one for this flavor.  oh, and definitely go 6 oz cup.  my oldest granddaughter and i contest for the peppermint chocolate.  she wins, of course, but it is pretty good when i can get one.  no marshmallow needed.  the hint of peppermint is just enough.  6 oz cup on this one is the best way to go, too.br br i think i got the cups sizes right.  if i did not, you will figure it out.  btw, i would imagine the reason it is always out of stock is because people keep buying it!  i have dipped into the supply well a few times myself.  pretty good. pretty cheap. pretty hard to get at times.  i will buy it again!\n",
      "not bad. not bad at all.\n",
      "everyone in my family likes hot cocoa. i was running plain water through my kcup maker and using hot cocoa from a canister but my kids did not really get the right measurements and more often than not we would have overflow. so i decided to try this for my kids and it makes a perfect cup every time. no overflow. the taste is good, its creamy with enough cocoa to water ratio for my kids. i will be ordering this product from now on for my family.br in the interest of product comparison, we have ordered timothys white hot chocolate, and green mountain hot cocoa, timothys was great, but pricy, and green mountain did not really taste all that great to our family. it had a watered down taste to it.\n",
      "perfect cocoa\n",
      "when i weigh the convenience of a k cup against the price and the taste, i would characterize these as a winner. not the best cup of cocoa on the planet but compared to making it yourself or using a packet, these are pretty darn good. they nice a nice chocolate flavor with no funny after taste that i have had with some other brands. do not select 10 oz on your machine though. make it only at 6 or 8 oz otherwise it will be watery in my opinion. all in all a fine cup of hot chocolate.\n",
      "tasty and at a great price.\n",
      "i am actually surprised at how good this product is. i am a cuisinart keurig owner with two teens that love to drink hot cocoa and cider pretty much year round.br br price point: the price for these at the store  exact brand  is almost triple of what we pay here for the same amount, with subscribe and save this makes these quite affordable for my family use. in comparison to other more expensive brands it is a great bargain without sacrificing quality over quantity.br br flavor wise: my kids love it, and have already asked me to purchase more. my daughter says that the peppermint is right on and not too weak even if using a larger cup. i love the dark chocolate in my coffee to make a mocha  10oz coffee to 4 oz chocolate  and it is much better than some other brands that i have tried in the past.br br overall impression:  great value, good flavor, excellent price point i will be purchasing more.\n",
      "much better than expected, great for the kids\n",
      "ordered on a whim.  my first grove square purchase.  great for the familys occasional cocoa desire.  being a kcup it is fast and easy.  was a little worried the cocoa might leave some after taste in my coffee, so far so good.  great cup of dark, rich cocoa.  maybe could taste a little better if it was from a gourmet brand you mix yourself with steamed milk.  the ease and simplicity, and lack of clean up, make this a better option for me.  will order again.  nice to see it on subscribe and save.\n",
      "rich, thick cocoa.  surprisingly good!\n",
      "my box of grove square hot cocoa arrived today and i have just tried it. delicious. made a big cup by mistake but i am happy with the flavor and consistency.  no off tastes that i can discern.  a little disappointed at high sodium content. nice to have as fall starts to chill.\n",
      "pleasantly surprised\n",
      "i really, really dislike sucralose.  i do not like the taste, the aftertaste, or the after effects.  i bought this based on it not saying it was diet or low calorie.  the first ingredient is sugar so it is only partially sweetened with sucralose.  sucralose is buried way down in the ingredients list but the taste is noticeable.br br sure wish amazon contained the full nutrition and ingredients labels from all food products.\n",
      "sucralose!\n",
      "ok  this is not the finest european chocolate.  but, you can make it in your keurig and all 3 flavors taste good.  i have joined the club and get the lowest possible cost.  no charge to join and no effort to quit.  why not?  it is nice to have when you are dieting, because it is just enough chocolate to keep you on track.  nondieters will like it for the convenience.\n",
      "tasty and good for weight watchers!\n",
      "i have tried a few different hot cocoa brands for my keurig... and have been disappointed every time, until now! cocoa brews smooth and full flavoredon either the small cup size or the medium! i add a splash of almond milk and i am ready to go : perfect! i will definitely buy this again.\n",

      "kcups\n",
      "i really like hot cocoa!  i like it sooo much that i have a cocoa latte machine, which is great, but sometimes i just want one cup of cocoa not a whole pitcher.  when that happens i used to put on the kettle and heat up the water, then pour in a packet of cocoa mix and stir, and stir, and stir.  and after all that stirring, i would still get little lumps in my cocoa.  with the kcups, i get smooth rich cocoa with no lumps and no cleanup.  easy and yummy!br br please note: these are not sugarfree.  the very first ingredient in each flavor is sugar and i did not see any artifical sugar listed in the ingredients.  each cup has only 60 calories, but if you want sugarfree or are diabetic then this product is probably not for you.\n",

      "good hot chocolate\n",

      "good flavor and wont break the bank\n",
      "this is the absolute best hot cocoa for the keurig brewers. all of the other hot cocoas that we have tried we had to doctor to make them taste good. we had to add more cocoa and more sugar. i was pretty much making my own cocoa, which defeated the purpose of the brewer. but the grove square hot cocoa does not need any help. in my opinion, it has just the right amount of flavor!!\n",
      "favorite hot cocoa!\n",

      "yummy hot chocolate\n",
      "i am giving this product 5 stars because i think it is great considering that it is made with water.  the hot chocolate is best if you shake the cup and then brew using the smallest possible cup size.  if you want a large cup of hot chocolate, use 2 kcups.  it is fairly low in calories, most likely because artificial sweeteners are necessary to get all the ingredients into the little kcup.\n",
      "pretty good hot chocolate\n",
      "i wish i had listened to the other bad reviews.  the artificial sweetener taste is awful.  i gave two stars only because my husband does not seem to mind.  i cannot drink this even if they were a bargain.\n",

      "good buy\n",

      "kcups are a godsend; among kcups, these are near the top.br br the keurig brewer is a blessing, hot beverages in seconds, mostly coffee; but there are greater and lesses among the coffees, and so, it seems, among the hot cocoas.br br this is so rich and vibrant, it announces itself from two rooms away.  silky, smooth, bursting with all the things chocolate is supposed to deliver, it is a musthave in this household.\n",

      "great taste and does not have the weird chalky after taste that other hot cocoa kcups have.  i have tasted several and this by far is the better one, but i have to say anything larger than 8oz tastes a bit watered down.  will definitely purchase more, but at the rate my family downs these, we are probably going to stick to the powdered hot cocoa to be more cost effective.\n",

      "these are so nice and creamy!  usually i do not justify buying kcups for things like cocoa that you can get cheaper in a packet, but this is so convenient and very good tasting .. way better than most powdered cocoa packets i have tried.  as far as price comparison, it is equivalent to gourmettypes of cocoa that would easily cost 1 per packet.  i also like that it comes in a variety pack with 3 flavor options.  highly recommend\n",
      "yumm!!\n",
      "i ordered this wanting to try a hot chocolate on my keurig, and i am very happy with this product. i will definitely be ordering it again. that being said, i dislike hot chocolate made completely of water, so i do add a splash of half and half to my cup when i make this. thus, i did not want to give it a 5 star rating since i do doctor my cup up a bit at home otherwise i would have. however, i will not even venture to make a cup of hot chocolate in a packet from the grocery store with water, i use 100 milk usually for those and they still do not measure up to this product from grove square. so, the fact that this tastes so good made with water and a bit of creamer to me speaks volumes. i do have to say that this is by far the best cup of instant cocoa that i have ever tried at home. compared to the swiss miss in the cupboard this had a distinctly grown up taste to it. i am a big fan!\n",
      "yum!\n",

      "wow, i did a lot of reading trying to make a good decision on a kcup hot chocolate, and of course taste is something that is very subjective.  if you read all the reviews on every product you will discover that nothing gets past everyone and maintains a perfectly spotless reputation.  so i decided that even with some bad reviews i would try this one since it has a lot of good reviews.  i am just going to say that there are some real hot chocolate connoisseurs writing reviews in this thread.  some discerning reviewers say it has a slight taste of sugar substitute, or some such thing.  all i can tell you is i must have underachieving taste buds because all i can taste is yummy hot chocolate.  my family burned through the first box and i just ordered two more.  if you do not like this i feel sorry for you. better to have numb taste buds i guess.  enjoy.\n",

      "this soup cooks up quickly and is very yummy! i really like the flavor of the seasoning packet and the way the noodles cook up, nice texture. it is very satisfying to me. i am a single gal who does not really cook  am often in a hurry for my next meal, and i find that this soup really hits the spot. although it does tend to be more of a midafternoon snacklight lunch item for me. it will tide you over for a while until your next big meal, but i have to agree with the other reviewer that if you try to have just one of these for dinner you can expect to be hungry in a few hours.br br personally i looove this soup that much more because i had to give up the ramen cup o noodle and some other brands i had been eating because i developed an allergy to shellfish and mollusks.  it seems that often these instant noodle packetsbowls either have some type of seafood in the sauce or they are manufactured on equipment that also processes shellfish. this one does not contain any type of seafood like many of the other instant noodles do. another plus for me is that it is not spicy. i am kind of a wimp with spicy foods, plus i have gerdreflux, so believe me if i can eat it is not spicy. just tasty :br br one thing that bugs me a little is that i feel guilty about the packaging since the plastic bowl is not recyclable in my town they only take 1s and 2s which of course these microwave safe bowls are never made out of. oh well, cannot have it all....\n",

      "i have to say that i really wanted to like these muffins, but i could not.  they have a really bitter after taste.  whether this is attributable to the gluten free nature of the product, i do not know.  the hodgson mill blueberry muffin mix is a far better choice.  on a positive note, they do raise very nicely, but it is unfortunate that i find them barely edible and have five more boxes of the mix left.\n",
      "a bitter pill\n",
      "i baked my first batch of these muffins and was pleased that they were so easy to make and tasted so good.  then i stored them in the refrigerator since gluten free home baked goods are notorious for molding.  i ate one straight out of the frig and it was great!  i guess the flavors melded together after being stored a few hours.  i finished the batch one at a time out of the frig without reheating any of them.  they were so good that way i could not bring myself to try them any other way.  :br br our family has been navigating the area of gluten free eating for over 10 years.  the choices just keep getting better as more companies are becoming aware of celiac disease.  i have created an astore through amazon that has the gluten free items we have had the pleasure of trying. ...\n",
      "really good muffins!\n",
      "i really wanted these to taste good, but there is something in there that is very bitter. i had to add too much sugar to make them even slightly palatable. no one would eat them. they looked delicious after baking and they are healthy, but that is only if you manage to choke one down. i have tried their gingerbread, corn muffin mix, and jalapeno cornbread mix and those are all great.\n",
      "oh so bitter tasting......\n",
      "if people would read the ingredients they would be less critical of the end product.  i only tried them as pancakes and they lent themselves most excellently. i used an erythritol instead of sugar and they tated great and cooked very well.  i did not even use a blender to mix.\n",
      "wonderful blend of millet, garbanzo and brown rice flour\n",
      "this item did not have the pleasant taste that most of hodgson mills products have, such as the wild blueberry muffin mix.  however, i found it greatly improved the flavor  added nutrition if i grated an apple into the mix. it increased the much needed moisture,  it was certainly a nutritious breakfast.\n",
      "not the best of hodgson mill products\n",
      "this product comes from a very good company that makes a number of excellent gluten free as well as nongluten free baking products. do not let the poor quality of this one product keep you from trying other products they make. this mix is a classic example of a very poorly designed and likely untested gluten free product. it lacks enough sugar and moisture ingredients to make the finished product taste good and mix well. as with many gluten free products new to the market, you find yourself constantly adding something to try to make it right. to these, i had to add nearly a full cup of sugar to begin to dissipate the very bitter taste. i added both applesauce and plain yogurt during different baking sessions to get a consistency that would feel and move like a muffin mix. this mix takes too much doctoring to be recommended at all until hodgson mill goes back to the drawing board and fixes this. but, hodgson mill does have other good products. try their blueberry muffin mix and hope that one day amazon will carry a wider array of their gluten free offerings as many are very, very good.\n",
      "poor food design!!!\n",
      "these came out smaller than i expected, but the taste as not as good as i thought it should be.  second time, i added a couple of items, which helped a little, but it is hard to find a great tasting boxed muffin mix.  i thought it would save me time, but i like my own muffins better.  my husband thought they were okay, but not great.\n",
      "not as expected\n",
      "i could not get these to work for muffins, so i decided to try the pancakes and was not disappointed. they come out perfectly raised every time. i like to make these without any sugar in the batter. the flax makes it very bitter, but i like them like that with lots of butter. however, if you just add some syrup on top, it extinguishes the bitter taste on contact. give these a try!\n",
      "love these! for pancakes\n",
      "i have never prepared anything so disgusting.  the taste was a mix of sour milk and cardboard, the smell just as bad.  i had to take the trash out because the whole room was beginning to smell.  i bake often, so i know it is not a kitchen error and i am not that picky, but i could not stop gagging. i would recommend pamelas browniesadd extra dark chocolate and they are delicious as brownie bite cookies side recipe on the bag.  i even make them super healthy and use 12c applesause instead of oil!\n",
      "i could not stop gagging\n",
      "i bought these at my local grocery store. i wish i would have read the review on here first. the positive is they do hold together well and look like a muffin. the negative is they are so bitter. i could barely finish my half. i just recently found out i have celiac disease  so i cant have gluten. i have never tried a gluten free muffin mix before so i can not compare it to any others. i have tried the betty crocker gluten free brownie mix and that is wonderful. so i do believe there would be a good muffin mix out there.\n",
      "bitter and a disappointment\n",
      "these muffins will not win any prizes for flavor.  i agree with other reviewers that the aftertaste is somewhat bitter and compared to at least what i remember of real muffins with sugar, gluten, eggs, butter, and that other good stuff they are quite fine.br br i do not eat gluten, derivatives of sugar cane, eggs, soy, dairy, corn . . . i could go on but you get the idea.  in order to use this mix i had to make substitutions and was delighted with what tastes like a treat to me.  aside from the fact that i do not have to measure out three kinds of flour to make something from scratch, the best thing about these muffins is the texture.  texture is a challenge absent gluten, sugar, and eggs, and i found this to be very much like how i remember muffins.  the bits of dried apple make these chewy and kind of weirdly so.br br overall, i am pleased with my purchase.\n",
      "a break from allergy baking from scratch\n",
      "i have 2 children with food allergies, so i have to use egg, milk and butter substitutions for these muffins, and it works well.  i add a little more sugar to the mix and top the muffins with a brown sugar and pecan mixture before i bake them.  all my kids love them!  you can top with just brown sugar if you cannot have or do not like pecans.  i love these muffins as well!\n",
      "very good mix!\n",
      "folks who are comparing this to hodgsons blueberry muffin mix obviously do not require glutenfree products since the blueberry are whole wheat muffins. if, like me, you require gluten free, this is a great product. this is the first flavorful gf baked good i have stumbled upon. very simple and quick to make. like all gf products, they are pretty dense in the end, but the apples make for a nice addition and they fill you up. personally, i added a bit more sugar xylitol than the recipe calls for. next batch, i will also add some fresh apples and extra cinnamon. my only complaint is that you get so little out of the box makes 6 small muffins.\n",
      "good and gluten free\n",
      "i was really excited and surprised when i found this mix in my local wal mart. given it was a good price, i figured id give it a shot.... before i whipped up a batch i figured id do a little investigating to see if there was any input suggestions on the mix. wow. is everyone using the same mix or what? reviews from its great to its horrible..like a total 5050 split. soooooo, before  i wasted a bunch of money on products to whip up a batch and see for myself, i figured id simply open the packae up and take a taste to the mix, all on its own.... ummmmm, yeah. it totally has a pretty strong bitter after taste. : and , like another reviewer, i had figured this mix would be adequately sweet enough for me and not need any extra sweetener i dont like things very sweet, at all but its def not. as i re read the ingredients i realized there isnt any sugarsweetener in this mix so, youd def need to add sweetening. but, overall, i dont even plan on taking this mix that far. im pretty certain that adding sugar wont take that aftertaste away. thats an issue with the flour mix and no amount of sugar is going to make that go away..... id strongly suggest avoiding this mix.... i hope the company works on this mix. it has good elements to it i like the fact you can determine how sweet youd want it and the apple pieces are pretty tasty and i think it could be really tasty.\n",
      "so many mixed reviews..\n",
      "if i could, i would give it zero stars.  i am not a picky eater, but this mix did not rise can you say hockey puck, was extremely bitter, and not sweet even with the recommended amount of sweetener added.  save your money.\n",
      "nasty\n",
      "these muffins were very good made according to the recipe on the box, but when i changed the recipe a little, by substituting almond milk for the 2 milk, and extra virgin olive oil for the butter, they were great!  next time, i am going to try adding some grated carrots and not adding the sugar.  thank you hodgson mill for a wonderful gluten free product.\n",
      "great muffins!\n",
      "i bought this because i have celiac disease and was really craving some muffins.  i am not a health nut, i just cannot eat gluten.  with that said, this is nasty.  it calls for very little sugar, i figure for the health nuts, so i simply added more sugar since it said to sweeten to taste.  even with extra sugar, it leaves an extremely bitter taste in your mouth.  i would rather pass on muffins than ever taste something like this again.  on a positive note, the muffins do stay together and look like muffins and if you try the product and dislike it, you can mail in the bottom of the box and your purchase price for a refund.\n",
      "simply nasty\n",
      "i concur with previous reviewers in that these muffins have such a bitter taste! i also bake often and i am certain it was not me. my gluteneating husband did not like them either. they were also dense.br if you are looking for an apple cinnamon flavor and need a mix, you might be better off using pamelas baking mix which is awesome! and adding apples and cinnamon to it. the muffin recipe is on the back of the pamela bag.br in conclusion, i do not recommend these; they were really disappointing.\n",
      "probably would be better to make something like this from scratch\n",
      "my family really liked these muffins.  i also made them while on vacation at my sisters house, and her family loved them.  i just got back from a bible study full of pretty picky eaters, and they all said they were good.  they are usually pretty honest about how the glutenfree food i take tastes, even telling me once that some storebought cookies i took tasted like cardboard.br br i did notice a very slight bitter aftertaste, but it was not too bad.  i think next time i make these i may take the advice of one other reviewer and add a grated apple for that extra touch.  oh, and i only added 3 tbs of sugar and think they were really good, as did everyone else who ate them.  i am sure that if you add even more sugar, the slight aftertaste could disappear altogether.br br i just went to the hodgson mills website and saw that they did recently change the formulation to this mix, so maybe that improved the aftertaste.  this mix does not have garbanzo flour.  they use sorghum instead, now.  i did not make these as muffins.  i found that one box is perfect for 2 mini loaves, which i prefer to muffins.  very good.  i will continue to make these when i need something fast and do not have time to make it from scratch.br br oh, and to the poster who asked about gluten free pasta, tinkyada makes a great brown rice pasta.\n",

      "i have a pure breed gsd and had problems for years with upset stomach, eating grass and throwing up bile in the morning and then would not eat as her stomach was too upset.  it finally dawned on me that due to throwing up bile in the am was that the food was not staying with her.  i even tried feeding her before going to bed at night and still did not work.  i tried evo and i could not believe the change.  she does not get us up at night to go outside.  she was having 34 bowel movements every day and now she has 1 or sometimes 2.  i have had her on the evo large bites for almost a year now and she has not been sick once.  it is the higher protein in this food that stays with her longer and has made all of our lives so much better.  thank you, thank you evo!!!\n",

      "we have a golden retriever and had been feeding him the wellness dog food.  he ate it begrudgingly so we decided to find something else.  i read the ingredients on the evo red meat and was really impressed.  i gawked at the price but decided cheaper dog food is not really a bargain if your dog will not eat it or get any enjoyment out of it.  the first time we fed it to him he pretty much inhaled it and will literally go sit by the bag and look at it like it might just open if he stares at it hard enough!  i agree with the first reviewer that loose stools are a factor but believe with time that will clear up.  he is just so happy that we will keep on buying it for him, although i wish the price were a little more reasonable.\n",
      "so worth it!\n",
      "i have been feeding my gsd the red meat formula for about 6 months and all i can say is wow. before i started him on this food he had problems with skin allergies and being picky about food. although the price for this food is a little daunting it is worth the price! you feed about half the amount you normally would since its so nutrient dense so one bag lasts us almost a month where a bag of purina would last us about 2 weeks. his skin allergies also cleared up in about month and his coat has never looked better and the dandruff is gone too. the only down side is when you first switch over it can cause some loose stoolsbut it gets better once their digestive system gets adjusted. all in all if you can afford to feed them evo its well worth the investment!\n",
      "great food!\n",
      "when i got my dog i did a lot of research regarding dog food and dog food ingredients. there are high quality dog foods like this one out there, but you probably will not find them in regular supermarkets. while this food may be more expensive than other dog foods, it is well worth it. innova evo is one of the foods that were not affected by the recall. also, the ingredients are healthier, and do not have high wheatgrain content or nasty additives.br br my doberman used to have a lot of dandruff and had some skin problems. also her poop was really mushy, almost diarrhea. when i finally switched her to innova evo red meat i would wished i would done it sooner. she does not need to eat quite as much, and her coat is beautiful! no more dandruff problems and her skin is great.\n",

      "my husband and i are not coffee drinkers, but we love hot chocolate. we hated the time it took to heat up the water,and the mess the dry mix sometimes makes. we saw that the keurig coffee maker did other things like hot chocolate and tea, liked that it was almost instant hot water, and bought one. i ordered another brand of hot chocolate kcup, and absolutely hated it. it had a weird almost metallic taste that was not sweet or chocolately. i was worried i wasted my money on a maker i would never use. i decided to try another brand and purchased the cafe escapes dark chocolate cocoa, and we absolutely love it! it is sweet and chocolately without being too bitterwhich is why i originally steered away from the dark chocolate. i fully recommend this product!!\n",

      "i did not purchase this product off of amazon. i purchased the 12 oz. bottle at a local store, and i must say it is one of the most addicting sauces i have ever had! i am a pretty picky eater, and a vegetarian at that, so sauces play a key role in making an average meal a great one. this sauce is almost perfect. it is very sweet, and has a strong garlic taste at first. it is not as thick as the red hot brand, which i did not like much at all thick, not as flavorful, way too chunky. this sauce would be appropriate for children who like a little kick for their chicken nuggets and what not. my son loves spicy food just like his mommy. another plus is there are only 70 calories in 2 tablespoons, and that much sauce goes a long way. 1 gram of fiber, too! the only thing i have a hard time with, and this is just a personal issue, is the texture of the red chilli. they tastes great, but they have a very thin, clear skin that has this horrible crunchy texture on some of the pieces. not all, just some. i get it stuck in my mouth and on my teeth and it hits a nerve that makes me feel a bit queasy. still, i eat it anyway lol and will continue to do so because this is one of the best sauces i have ever tasted! i would recommend anyone to try this sauce first, and then try others if you are not fully satisfied. this sauce is amazing. it was about 1.50 at the store for 12 oz. but if you like the easiness of ordering online or cannot find it near you, know that i would pay amazons price for it any day! buy this sauce. i do not care where or how, just buy it. you will fall in love!\n",

      "classic condiment\n",
      "i was excited to try this sauce based on the reviews, but it is nothing special. for my taste, it is way too sweet and not nearly spicy enough even my kids agree. it reminds me of honey mixed with sweet pickle relish, so if that sounds good to you, go for it. but if you are more interested in something more spicy, hot and even a little sour, you might want to keep looking.\n",

      "high quality body wash that is very thick and lathers quickly and easily. it has a very pleasant, flowery smell that lasts for hours after you get out of the shower. you only have to use a small amount about the size of a quarter to last your entire shower. so even though the product is expensive, you will get a lot of use out of it. it seems that the cheaper, dollar a bottle kind i sometimes use only lasts a week or 2 because i have to use more of the product to last throughout a shower.br br i would say the smell lasts for around 6 hours or so so it is almost like perfume. my sisterinlaw asked me yesterday, you always smell so good. what do you wear? i was not wearing any perfume of any kind at the time because it was very early in the morning before i had done my morning routine and i had to run something over there to her. i told her that it must just be the body wash. if you have ever used dove shampoo or conditioners, it is almost the same smell.br br i am looking forward to trying the cucumbergreen tea kind when i run out of these 4 bottles. i would totally recommend this for yourself or for any woman in your life: aunt, mother, girlfriend, wife. i know many women who would never buy this dove product because they always choose their children and families over themselves, ie buying themselves whatever is cheapest. i intend on buying some of this for my mom and aunt to maybe put in a gift basket or care package for them.br br i also use this as bubble bath when i take a nice hot bath. excellent product. a from me.\n",

      "great product and value.\n",
      "yes, i have bought this before. i like the smell and detest the bottle design. i do agree with one of the reviewers that the dove does sell their liquid soaps in pump form in asian countries and sell the refills for them as well. i would like it if they have that... but i must make due with what i can get at this point in time.br br i decided to redo the way i do my bath routine the way i currently do is so time consuming. it takes almost an hour to take a shower.br so i am on amazon finding things to aid in my new innovated routine.br br like i said before, i have bought this product in walmart but only the single bottles or double bottles that happened to be on sale. i love the product it makes me feel soft and silky. the scent is pleasant. not over powering at all. light.br br i do not buy lotion, they are often heavy and make me feel greasy or they feel weird on my skin. i am of the chocolate complexion so i tend to get extremely ashy because i do not like the way i feel after putting on lotion, so i buy dove body wash, deep moisture. i get clean, moisturized and do not feel greasy after i get out the shower.br br edit!br br i have solved the oddly shaped bottle problem, buy or find one lying around the house, a soap pump for hand soap.br i recommend the ones that have had hand soap in them as they are conditioned for everyday use and can hold a thicker capacity soap like this the manufacturer had the bottles made specifically for their product, their product is thick. i have read and heard that the ones you buy empty are for thin lotions and what not.br br if you use an old soap bottle clean it out first and fill with the dove soap, and use in the shower, if you can find a 24 oz bottle maybe from one of doves hair pumps rinsed out, they are 25oz, big enough to fit all of it and strong enough for thick products such as this. 25oz eliminates the frustrating last bit at the bottom, anything smaller store the remaining in a drawer in the corner upside down so you can squeeze the rest in the bottle without fighting with it too much, by the time you get to that second half in the bottle it will be where you want it and you do not come out the shower looking like you got into a fight with a dove soap deep moistruizing body wash bottle...  xd\n",
      "i have bought this before\n",
      "both my husband and i use this body wash.  we both have dry skin and feels it does a really good job as a moisturizing body wash.  it is a little pricey here, basically comparable to store prices walmartsupermarket.  i order for convenience, one less item i have to waste time at a store gettingwith our busy lives it is needed so we tend to get many items from amazon, mostly through the subscribe and save program.\n",

      "sardines are a useful item to stock for times when you want to add a bit of protein to your meal without breaking the bank. i like that they are lower in mercury than big fish are, and high in omega fats. the skinless ones are much better tasting in my opinionregular sardines taste a bit too oily, fishy, and strong to me. they are fairly neutral with the absence of added oil or much salt and this makes them versatilei sometimes add lemon and mayonnaise for a sandwich filling, mix with egg, oatmeal, onion and lemon and fry for a fish patty, or add them to a salad. although i think these from roland are very good, i liked the seasons skinless sardines, which are also sold by amazon, even better for flavor and texture.\n",

      "i will admit, the icicle does allow you to plug any mic with an xlr jack to your computer using a usb jack. it does indeed provide phantom power to condenser mics and it will deliver a signal to your recording software.br br beyond that, the usefulness depends on your mic and what you consider an acceptable recording level.br br i tried this with an akg 200, blue encore 200 and an akg 4500. all deliver very nice sound when used in a conventional recording chain. i could barely get an audible record level yelling into the encore 200, my staple for location voice recording. normally, i plug the encore directly into a digital audio recorder with an xlr cable. no mic preamp, no phantom power, no eq, and i get a good clean clear sound level near the peak of input level.br br this is one very disappointing product. if you route your mic through a preamp, then put the icicle between the preamp and the usb input of your computer, you can get a decent record level, but that extra equipment is what this light weight gadget is supposed to avoid. personally, i think you might be better off getting a decent channel strip or mic preamp and an xlr to to mini jack to go between the channel strip and your computer input and forget the icicle altogether.br br blue makes some great products, but this is not one of their better ones.br br for those that do not know, channel strips combine several pieces of equipment into one box: typically a mic preamp and a compressor. higher end units add some eq capability as well or have other options.\n",

      "patrick gave a spot on explanation of everything, just in different uses. personally, i use it vocally, and acoustically and it has worked perfectly in every way, however, either something is lacking in craftsmanship or  i find my ability to adjust by feel is a little more connected to using numbers instead of blanks. i found the quality just like patrick said. i too think it feels almost fragile; and, i also used...a mic cable because for me, that seemed the most sensible solution because i did not really need it to move it. so, i mounted the connection to my desk; and now i move it very little. aside from the no dial or indicators for how far you have turned it, on the gain knob, i think it would be awesome if they just threw in some molded heavy something to give it some weight for setting on your desk. that would make it secure and you would feel like it had a little better quality in craftsmanship. hey maybe even give the connector itself a littl weight to stay put. anyways, great product but i guess, thats what... he said?... regardless,br br pros: does what it says. get it if you need it. its at an amazing price compared to the a hrefhttp:www.amazon.comgpproductb001ppxfagshure x2u xlrtousb signal adaptera version. this, however, is fantastic for people saving for a new presonus interface like me.br br cons: craftsmanship appears lacking.\n",
      "almost five\n",
      "plugged direct into windows and controlled via ustream.tv software interface  this worked well, although we needed a little more gain  obtainable by using better software  cubase, garage band etc, as an interim setup before we could get a more pro level interface for more than one mic etc.  nice!br it feels a bit flimsy construction wise  but we were not going to take it on the road!\n",
      "used for audience mic pickup\n",
      "i use this to record in garageband on my macbook. it works unfailingly and sounds as good as it should considering my primitive setup. i love the level knob and the quality construction. if you read the instructions and use it correctly, this tool is invaluable.\n",
      "just what i needed\n",
      "this product works. if you are only looking to do vocals this is a good product. so far i have had it a few months with no experience of sound distortion or loss of power. its great if you do not want to go to the trouble of figuring out how to use a mixer. i have been told a preamp is better but it seems to work alright for me and my mxl 67g.\n",
      "it works\n",
      "i have purchased a few of these, and they are very reliable. i have used them with win7 and os x. the ad quality is acceptable for most needs. the limited bit depth and sample rate are probably the only drawbacks.\n",
      "works well if all you need is 16bit, 48khz mono\n",
      "i was really worried when i ordered this that the phantom power would make it overheat, apparently i was worried for nothing! i use this paired with a blue yeti pro, a seriously beefy microphone, running over shielded cable that is about eighty feet away, it is absolutely great!br br the one downside that i have seen from this piece of kit: it will occasionally not register as a usb device, granted i only have seen it happen once, but you will always want to double check your connections!\n",
      "cold as ice\n",
      "cheap and works well the only thing is the gain on it is a little low even at highest setting. other than that ir records well and does what it needs to.\n",
      "the blue icicle is decent\n",
      "never really intended to use this in a professional setting so the noise issue is not that big of a deal. just wanted a simple device that could fit in my backpack to interface with my laptop for impromptu interviews and music recordings. for the price paid, it is very cheap and lightweight plastic construction leaves much to be desired. overall, i can not recommend this product at the current price it is sold at. 15 to 20 dollars, then sure. still, it is an ok product.\n",
      "a tad bit noisy and cheaply made\n",
      "it is what is is... and it did the job that it was made for. lasts long if u take care of it but is easily out grown when just starting ur own studion\n",
      "iffy\n",
      "i create language teaching materials for a living on both pcs and macs. not only do i care about the sound quality of audio recordings for voice, but i record a lot of music as well. for work i that i do at home, i bought the blue microphones icicle to use with high quality condenser mics. before buying i read lots of reviews here and some others online.br br when the icicle arrived, it worked fine right of the bat. since then i have recorded hours and hours of audio on it, using both pcs and macs. not once have i had any problems with the product.\n",
      "does the job and does it well\n",
      "perfect tool for any musicians trying to make recording much easier at an affordable price.br easy to open plastic case, medium sized, durable people have said that the plastic body feels cheapbr and feels easy to break but it is not true. the icicles plastic body feels durable and will not break ifbr you are not clumsy with it or break it on purpose. i only wished that the gain control had numbers or indicationsbr of levels so i can turn the knob to the correct position for recording and remember it instead of guessing all the time. sound quality is flawless! no buzzing noises or anything picked up really...just nice crispy sound recorded through a good quality microphone is all i hear. i hear no difference in it with an icicle or a mixer\n",
      "perfect!\n",
      "this product works just as advertised!! guitar center told me the only way to connect my mic to my computer was either an expensive converter box or a usb mic. aholes haha. i love this little gizmo and would definitely recommend it to a friend!!\n",
      "works perfect!\n",
      "i bought the icicle because i have been doing a lot of hiphop vocals and i was using a samson c01u and the thing with that mic you can get close to studio but with so much work and you can always tell that you messed with it alot.br br well i always wanted to buy a expensive mic but didnt want to spend 200 more on a usb preamp so i see this on here the other day and went to guitar center and after deciding for a while i went with it. i also already had a mxl v88 which is a pretty high end condenser mic, although now you can find it for cheap but original rspv700 and average selling price after it being out was 349400. but i am very happy.br br i use reaper to record vocals with a asio driver and it does work with my asio driver someone put in their comment that it doesnt. for those of you that arnt familure with asio it is a driverprogram that runs and samples your audio going in, you basically use it with anything that is midi or midimic to usb. it makes your audio not lag and sound more professional. also for the people that said the volume was too low, go into sound in windows and turn the mic up a little, i keep mine on 5. also your recording program will let you turn up while your monitoring the record or after.br br go ahead and buy one!\n",
      "awesome! buy for sure!\n",
      "i am glad i came across the blue icicle on amazon othere prices where 60 or more before i went on to buy a mic, preamp and source for phantom power. i literally got i all in one at a verrryyy low price. good bargain. i recomend it for anyone with a home studio and deff go buy a xlr cable. plugging a mic deirectly into it wont work so well.\n",
      "good\n",
      "a great tool for low budget home recording. i mic every track to audacity. i use a low budget dynamic mic and the icicle gives the right boost for pc recording. i keep the gain at 90 to 100 percent and do volume control on the pc.br i see some complaints out there about durability. keep in mind it is a piece of computer hardware like a modem or an external hard drive, not something that you would use onstage or throw into a gig bag. another plus is no drivers or setup. that is important to me when i get home from work and want to record a tune. just plug it in and go!\n",
      "cost effective solution for low budget home recording\n",
      "i needed the icicle to provide better audio quality for recordings i was doing on my pc. i wanted to use my high quality xlr mic for this purpose and found that the icicle provided far better performance than any other usb mic that i currently owned. i did not have any problem with the trim pod on the icicle as reported by a previous review so maybe blue mic has corrected that issue.br br i have and do recommend this to anyone that wants to use their current xlr mic on their pc. the product is great and the price is right.\n",
      "works great!\n",
      "great price for what you are getting.  recording via a usb port rocks!!!! the only thing that could maybe be improved is the durability.  it feels like a toothpick in your hand.  it may be more durable than it feels, but i am still going to be very careful with it.  but, for the price this is only a minor gripe.  great product, i would recommend it to anyone.\n",
      "excellent buy!!\n",
      "works well.  it is slightly lighter than expected, but the quality of the sound is excellent.\n",
      "feels like a small lightsaber\n",
      "i used the icicle for about two hours. after taking a break, i plug it in and my laptop wont recognize it. i did everything i could think of to fix this, even hours of searching google. nothing. in the process of a return.  it would have been perfect if it just worked.\n",
      "worked for 2 hours, then stopped.\n",
      "it works reasonably well with condenser microphones.  with dynamics the hum exceeds the signal.  works with windows, not with linux.  the build is very cheap.  anything more than 5 for this is too much.\n",
      "leave this one on the shelf\n",
      "muy buen producto. por su tamantilde;o, uno lo puede llevar a culquier lado junto con su laptop y hacer culquier grabacioacute;n, en cualquier momento. antes de tener este producto, tuve muchos problemas con la entrada de audio en mi mac, pero con el icicle por fin pude tener una entrada decente para cualquier microacute;fono. hasta el momento no genera ruidos de ninguacute;n tipo y la calidad es impresionante para algo tan simple.\n",
      "transportable y buen sonido!\n",
      "i bought this device and use a brand new sure 52 with it.br br the noise and feedback i received with this device was horrible  i might have a bad unit.br br when i called customer service, a real person answered right away and offered to expedite getting me a new unit. very cool and is why i gave them 3 stars for nowbr br i will see how that process goes and update my review.\n",
      "still up in the air\n",
      "bought it thinking this would plug into the wii and i would be able to use my condenser microphone with it. well, long story short, doesnt work. but it is still usable with a pclaptop to record audio. but we can do that with a builtin mic also. would u like to pay 1 towards the presidential election?\n",
      "no good for wii\n",
      "shipping: ordered on a sunday of week 1.  placed in box on a friday of week 2. received it wednesday of week 3. whoevers responsible for shipping amazon or blue took their sweet time to drop it in this 8x5 box.br br product: currently testing the converter with a shure pg58. gain is incredibly low and a annoying tone when recording. i do believe the product is in working condition; too bad i have to figure out how to edit the hardware properly.\n",

      "i ordered this item on march 22nd.  i expect to get its replacement from the people at blue sometime today.  so, what is a month, anyway?  the first one that came from amazon had a constant, highpitched tone.  i emailed, then called blue, and eventually spoke to a pleasant tech support guy who was aware of the problem. he allowed that the company had shipped out a number of units with this defect.  that is always good to hear.  so, several emails later, i received a return merchandise authorization, and shipped it right back to them.  who knows, if this one works, maybe i will like it.  blues products look good, but they make a strong case for buying locally.\n",

      "great stuff!\n",
      "the first time we cracked open a box of bisquick gluten free and made a batch of pancakes, i was surprised. they were delicious! perhaps the best pancakes i have ever had. we did make a couple modifications from the box recipe. instead of using oil, we use the same amount of melted butter. and we add fresh blueberries to each pancake as it is cooking. then, serve with whipped cream. so great! i am looking forward to trying some of the other recipes with this, including pizza crust.\n",
      "bisquick gf  so delicious!\n",
      "i really like it when my wife makes anything from her betty crocker cookbook, so i know when we got the gluten free pancakes that they would be good.  they are not overly dry like some of the other brands of gluten free pancakes.br br we usually have them with earth balance butter spread, and sliced bananas or sliced strawberries, chopped pecans or walnuts and maple syrup.  they are great.\n",
      "really good gluten free pancakes\n",
      "a few years ago, going gluten free was really difficult. i missed the basic things i loved to eat and pancakes were certainly one of them. i tried other mixes but the batters were very dry and required items to moisten them such as fruit, etc. but bisquicks gf pancake mix was surprisingly good! it is a great alternative to the real thing. certainly all of us gluten sensitives out there know it will never be that delicious stack of buttermilk pancakes like we once knew, but i am happy to know there is a great alternative. :\n",
      "great alternative!!\n",
      "this replaces many of other brands of pizza crust mix, cake mix, foccaccia and more.  the only reason i do not give it 5 stars is that it is slightly pricey, but that is an issue of living gluten free.  enjoy and be creative with it.\n",

      "great simple gf mix\n",
      "i have been glutenfree for a little over a year and i have struggled with finding tasty and affordable alternatives to my favorite foods. the great thing about this mix is that it is really easy to make, affordable, and the pancakes are so tasty, my children do not object to eating themsaving me the time of making two batches of pancakes. if they did not see me eating them, i do not even think my kids would notice that they are eating glutenfree pancakes.\n",
      "easy and tasty\n",
      "been gluten free for 7 years now. thought we were done with mixes that tasted awful.  we threw it away because we did not like it. for my money, you cannot beat pamelas baking mix. but, the betty crocker chocolate chips are the best! so, do not give up betty crocker, just work on this one!\n",

      "so nummy!\n",
      "the first time i tried this product to make pancakes, i thought it was terrible.  i made it according to the directions and used the right measuring cups for liquid and dry ingredients, but found that the batter came out thin and the texture was gummy.  then, one day when i was visiting my mother, she decided to make pancakes, and since i am gf, she had bought this mix for me not knowing i had already hated it.  i saw that she measured the ingredients incorrectly as she used the same measuring cup generally used to measure liquids for both the dry and the liquid ingredients.  she also used a whisk to mix the ingredients.  amazingly enough, the pancakes came out fluffy, and i really liked it.  in fact, it is my favorite gluten free pancake mix so far.  having said that, both my husband and i are of the opinion that this product still has a bit of the gritty texture that is present in many gf products.  however, it is the best pancake mix that i have found so far.\n",
      "pretty good\n",

      "yea for gf!\n",
      "it makes good tasting gluten free food... but... like most gluten free food, it is expensive and it is got a slight grit to it. i have made biscuits, waffles, and pancakes with it... a friend made some awesome banana bread with it. it is very good for gluten free...\n",
      "good... but still gritty!\n",
      "it is great! i actually used this to make gf donuts the other day. i love how convenient it is. it is so hard being gluten free so this is god sent for how many things you can make with this. i have celiacs and i have not had any sort of negative reaction to this. i would definitely recommend this for anyone who cannot have gluten but still wants things like pancakes and waffles and donuts and other fun things.\n",
      "fantastic!\n",
      "the first brand of gf pancake mix i attempted was bobs red mill and i loved it. i went to the store to try to find it again and this was all they had so i tried it. it is... okay. i am eggfree too and used mushed banana instead, so maybe that contributed to the slight mushy texture but i made a batch of egg ones for my inlaws and they said it was a bit mushy too.br br it is not horrible, but i prefer brm brand personally.\n",
      "meh. not bad but a little bit of a mushy texture\n",
      "we use this mix for pancakes and waffles and it is perfect. we have had a terrible time finding a good all purpose flour that is gluten free the popular brands taste terrible! so we tend to use this pancake mix as a base for a lot of our recipes including breading for baked chicken and other things. it is definitely best as a pancake mix of course, but using it as a starting point for baking has helped us find normal tasting gluten free baked foods. :\n",
      "perfect!\n",
      "i recently went gluten free and this is one of my favorite mixes.  i used it for biscuits and pancakes and it is very good.  you can also use it for pizza dough and to make fried chicken  it is about average for that.\n",

      "i was hoping bisquick got it right when they released this product, but they missed their mark.br br i made both biscuits and dumplings chicken  dumplings. the biscuits came out okay but the flavor was bland. the dumplings were fluffy but not very flavorful and turned hard after a day or two.\n",

      "my husband is gluten intolerant and as with all gluten free products out there the results are not always the best.  he loves this product and since i only really make the pancakes i cannot say how the other bisquick recipes would turn out for any of you.  and yes he has this texture and taste thing with gluten free products as well...  gritty, sandy or off tasting.... etc. etc...  so i am happy he likes this one!  with gluten free products you really have to test them out one by one as some perform in the taste and texture area better than other blends.  my advice to anyone searching for gluten free products they want to try that it is best to buy them in the single packages, if possible.  i know on amazon they sell them in bulk but if you find that you do not like it you are then stuck with alot of packages you no longer want!  just a tip for all of you out there.  it may cost more for one package but the waste will be much less unless you donate them to the local food bank...  good product and great results!  thank you, bisquick!\n",

      "i have this on auto ship because i use it so much. i have gone to every grocery in az and the cheapest place is amazon! this is a great product and whatever you make using this flour will taste great. my son has celiac and is allergic to gluten. i have tried every pancake mix and this one is the one i settled for!\n",
      "cheapest place is amazon!\n",
      "this is a product that is delicious and easy to use. i made the pancakes with buttermilk and the recipe on the box just said milk. the buttermilk helped make the pancakes light and fluffy. i am a little disappointed that the box will only make one recipe that calls for two cups of the mix. i doubled my recipe for the pancakes which made 14br 4 inch pancakes.  the recipe says it makes 10 pancakes with 1 cup of the mix. those 10 pancakes must be silver dollar size.  i am looking forward to making the biscuits so i will have to open a second box to have enough mix. the recipe calls for eggs for biscuits and i never used eggs in my regular biscuits.  i am wondering if buttermilk would make these biscuits rise sufficiently? i have family members who cannot eat eggs or milk so i must adapt recipes for them. it is a product i would purchase again. however, i used subscribe and save on amazon and the time to receive the product was really long in my opinionordered nov. 19th received dec. 2nd. i know thanksgiving was in the midst of that time period but i thought i would have received the product before thanksgiving. i will try subscribe  save one more time to see if all things are so slow.a hrefhttp:www.amazon.comgpproductb004391dk0bisquick pancake and baking mix, glutenfree, 16ounce boxes pack of 3a\n",

      "this stuff is pretty solid. makes a decent enough pancake for being gf and makes a solid biscuit as well. what we have found works best is taking this mix and using it half and half with the chebe mix. between the two it makes for a very nice flour mix. the chebe is good but on its own tends to be a little squishy, but when you mix it with the bisquick, the bit of squishiness gives the dryer bisquick the fluffiness and moistness it needs. so, i recommend this, but i would highly recommend getting some chebe too and cutting the bisquick with it. also, even though this mix has leavening agents in it, when we use recipes that call for leavening agents we add them anyway, it tends to turn out better this way.\n",

      "i love this bisquick mix!  over the past 10 years, since being diagnosed wheat gluten intolerant, i have tried so many gluten free mixes that were so bad i ended up feeling like i might as well be eating the box!  this bisquick mix is by far the best i have found for making scones plain or sweet and biscuits!  the orange biscuits, cheddar biscuits and raisin scones i have made were delicious. it was easy to substitute this mix into my old recipes, because unlike some gluten free mixes, i found i can play around with this and do not have to measure everything absolutely precisely to get a good outcome.  of course, you cannot roll this dough out like traditional dough, it has to be dropped onto the baking sheet in spoonfuls.  i have found that if i do not make it too sticky, i can gently form the balls in my hands to give a more regular shape to my scones and biscuits. i have also used it for making deep dish chicken pie and pizza be sure you press it nice and thin in the pan  i use a silicone spatula to press it so that it does not stick. bisquick mix is made by the betty crocker company and this, along with the betty crocker cakes and brownie mixes, allows me to indulge in delicious baked goods again!  i have bisquick mix on subscribe and save, which makes it very affordable and makes sure that i do not ever run out!\n",

      "can as be used to make cookies  even egg free!  i just used the mix, enough apple sauce to make a batter, some coconut butter and added vanilla and cinnamon and baked.  turned out soft delicious cookies with only 5 minutes from box to the oven.  however, even wallmart carries this for about one dollar per box less than here.\n",

      "oki just bought bisquick gf and the first thing i tried to make were the drop biscuits recipe listed on the box.  these are not the kind that are rolled out  cutthese are drop biscuits.  the results were very tasty.  the taste of this gf bisquick is very much like the original, but the taste is not as tart as the original.  if you want a similar buttermilk taste, you will need to use buttermilk instead of milk in the biscuit recipe.  i noticed something else that was odd and might be a problem for anyone new to cooking; it seems that the amount of mix called for is not quite right.  i read the side of the box and it claims that there are 3 23 cups of mix in the box 11 servings of 13 cup each.  the biscuit recipe called for 2 cups of mix. i measured heaping teaspoonfuls into a measuring cup and i do not even have a cup of mix left in the bag?????  i know this mix does not have wheat flour and maybe that kind of flour measures differently, maybe if i dug into the bag with a cup, i would have used less, but the recipe came out right.  so, there must be a misprint on the box.  i am assuming i measured properly because i have biscuits that can be dipped in gravy, smothered with butter  jam, or sliced to make those yummy mcdonalds breakfast sandwiches. by following the instructions, i have a lot of biscuits.  if you are single, or just cooking for two; you might want to cut the recipe in half.  you will still have plenty and you will not go through the box so quickly.  this mix cost me around 5.00 and i do not have enough left to make anything else, without buying another box; which i will because these biscuits are really, really good.  still, if you are watching your budget, do not prepare more than you need.br br about these biscuits:  yummy, fairly golden because the recipe calls for eggs, and they can be sliced with some crumbly edges, just like glutenous ones.  without the eggs, you probably will not get the nice eyeappealing color.  even though they are drop biscuits, you still have to cutin shortening or margarine. if you do not have a cutter, you will need to use a long fork.  that is more difficult, so if you are a celiac that has been craving biscuits; buy a cutter.  it will cost you as much as a box of this mix.  the biscuit recipe also calls for milk, so if you want that nice tart taste that is reminiscent of the original bisquick; you will need to use buttermilk.br br the mix is made up of rice flour, sugar, leavening, potato starch, salt,  xanthum gum.  many mixes and goodies made with rice flour taste grainy.  bisquick has done a fantastic job with the rice flour.  it is not grainy at all; i repeat, it is not grainy at all.  for those of you new to celiac cooking; using a starch such as corn, potato, or tapioca is normal and adds a lightness to the baked item that would not be possible with rice flour alone.  leavening is simply baking soda or powder and is necessary for rising.  the sugar and salt are for flavor and consistency,  and yes, they are necessary.  as for the xanthum gum; it is a perfectly natural ingredient and it gives celiacsafe baked goods a bit of elasticity acting as a replacement for the gluten.  you will find xanthum gum in just about every baked goodie made for people with celiac disease.  can you just make your own mix and spend less money?  sure, but you will have a very difficult time finding rice flour as finely ground as the rice flour that is the predominant and main ingredient in this mix.br br the other recipes listed on the box are for pancakes, waffles, strawberry shortcakes, pizza crust, ultimate chicken fingers, and oven baked chicken.  you can find more recipes on their website.br br i recommend this product for the taste.  i do wish that more mix was in the box, for the price.\n",

      "...this mix does have that grainy texture found with a lot of ricebased glutenfree mixes. the mix works well when the directions are followed and it is fairly versatile.br br i will use the mix i have, but i am not sure if this will be a staple in my pantry. i am not finding myself reaching for it on a regular basis, which is usually a sign that this is not a hit in my household.\n",

      "when i discovered my sensitivity to gluten about 6 months ago, i was dismayed by most of the horrible glutenfree foods on the market. i have since found some substitute foods that are acceptable to me. bisquick glutenfree pancake and baking mix is one of them. i use it every sunday to make either pancakes or waffles. i recommend this mix wholeheartedly!\n",
      "i love this product\n",
      "i bought this immediately after finding out i could no longer have gluten. from everything i was reading it seemed daunting to mix different flours to make anything.br br the boxes are small!  while this mix is okay for making pancakes, the biscuits are alright, and to use it as a coating chicken fingers is eh, i am glad i bought it when i was first diagnosed.  it helped ease my transition into gluten free cooking and baking.br br now that i know what i am doing, i will not buy again.  it is much cheaper to make my own flour mixes at home and use those to make pancakes, biscuits, and breaking for chicken fingers.  and my own mix tastes much better.  but, if you are new to gluten free, definetly pick this up, it will help with the transition!\n",

      "i read lots of good reviews and loved the idea of the convenience of this mix for pancakes and waffles.  so i whipped up some pancakes, breakfastfordinner style.  i am newly diagnosed celiac and thus new to gf, so perhaps i should let a little more time go by on just a diet of naturally gluten free foods before i start trying substitute foods for the wheat foods i used to love, but i swear i cried a little bit when i ate these pancakes.  because i thought they sucked, frankly.  they are completely bland and have no flavor at all, and the texture was reminiscent of wallpaper paste. i do not know if that is gluten free but if so it is probably cheaper to just put some syrup on that and eat it! after letting the batter stand 10 minutes to thicken up a bit, it was more like kindergarten paste, but still totally flavorless.  my 2 year old daughter gobbled them up, so that is something.  then i cried a litle bit more thinking about the fact that i guess i will never get to teach her how to make a real, delicious fluffy wheat pancake, but that is a whole other thing.br br i am giving it 2 stars just because it is useful for breading oven baked chicken, but you could do that more economically with another gf flour.\n",

      "this product is beyond amazing! i have been cooking pancakes in assorted ways for four decades. and, for home use, no other product comes close to this bisquick gluten free mix. it is superior not only to every glutenfree product on the matter; it is also superior to every other mix glutenfree or not on the market. friends and family are constantly amazed and surprised when i serve them breakfast. so, to everyone and anyone, do not make the mistake of associating this bisquick product w other glutenfree products that result in food that tastes like cardboard.br last thought: thanks to amazon for making it available as a subscription purchase, since i can no longer find it in any south florida supermarkets.\n",

      "like the title says, i have tried nearly all the brands, spent a lot of money, and in the end these are the best gluten free pancakes i have had.br br i am not happy about the lack of fiber, and the the starchy flours used. but a handful of ground flax seed makes up for that.br br i am also happy about a brand that helps you to make biscuits and other things from the same mix. other companies sell biscuits and pizza dough as a separate item, duping the customer to spend even more money.br br compared to the many other brands, these do not have a funny taste or smell from odd flours. these are made mostly from rice and potato flours. you just feel normal.br br i hope they will come out with a whole grain version from brown rice and bean flour.br br tip: to get the fluffiest texture use butter instead of oil. room temperature butter.\n",

      "i like this product, and will order it online again since it is a much better price than the grocery store.  i wish the box was a bit bigger, but it will do.  it is plain, but it makes a light and fluffy pancake.  you can add flavor with vanilla extract, cinamon, or blueberries.  i liked the texture of the biscuit recipe, but it came out more like a muffin.  i am going to make it in a muffin pan next time and put cranberries in it.  i made my biscuits with butter.  if you are creative with the use of add ins, i think it would make good quickbreads, but not the rising type.\n",

      "every revolution product i have tried has been a wonderful experience.  revolution knows how to balance the inherit flavors of tea leaves with other ingredients which make each tea unique and enjoyable.br br better than the restbr br i have been buying this particular tea consecutively for the better half of a year now, and i simply love it. no other pomegranate tea comes close to this one in terms of quality and taste.  for example, trader joes store brand while good seems as if it has been sweetened to the point where it is too sweet, and surprisingly the tea turns red after less than a minute of seeping indicating that coloring was added i did not check the ingredients, so i may be wrong about this.  there is also yogis pomegranate tea which uses a green tea and creates an entirely different taste. i liked it; did not love it.br br complimenting flavorsbr br pomegranates are often compared to apples.  in fact, pomegranate means seeded apple from latin: pomum  apple and granatus  seeded, and like an apple the fruit is sweet and tart, but has a very strong and distinct flavor.  thus, a light white tea is the perfect companion; it does not overpower the pomegranate flavor but allows it to mingle on the tongue.  likewise, the amount of pomegranate, or rather the intensity of the pomegranate flavor, is truly perfect.  no flavor overpowers the other, but rather all the flavors compliment one another.br br brewingbr br i am sure someone out there will say that i am butchering tea when i brew this, but when i do, i leave the tea bag in the mug until i have consumed it all.  i find that the taste never gets too strong and never gets bitter.  typically this is only the case for herbal teas, which do not become overpowered since they contain no tea leaves.  in this case the same is true, perhaps because it is a white tea which is naturally light. the tea itself literally contains dried pomegranate seeds flesh included.  do you know that taste you get a few moments after you eat a pomegranate seed? if you do not, try it! it is wonderful.  that initial bite from the tartness followed by sweetness you get or at least i get from a pomegranate is captured in this tea, and it makes sense! there is pomegranate seeds in there!br br conclusionbr br buy this tea!  i was a little skeptical about my first purchase since i was buying 6 boxes, but it was a great choice that i do not in the least bit regret.  i have bought this for myself and for family, with everyone absolutely loving it. best 20 i have ever spent and continue to spend!\n",

      "like most melitta brews, i found this one to be somewhat middle of the road.  it is certainly not undrinkable, but it is not the first one i would reach for, either.  as many of the other reviewers mentioned, i did find it nearly undrinkable when brewed in the quantity shown; i think you have to at least double the amount you use to get a good cup, so take that into consideration when figuring the value.br br i am a little sensitive to caffeine and like to have a decaf on hand for drinking later in the day, and i bought this primarily to use with my mr. coffee frappe maker a hrefhttp:www.amazon.comgpproductb002fwmf8gmr. coffee bvmcfm1 20ounce frappe makera; let me just put in a quick pitch for that, i love it!  i found the riviera sunset stood up well to all the milk, flavoring, and ice inherent in making a frappe again, with a significant increase in the amount used.br br i would probably not purchase this coffee just because of my own views on coffee; i look for birdfriendly, fair trade brands, and i find nothing to indicate that melitta makes any effort to meet these expectations.  leaving aside these considerations, though, i think those who enjoy a somewhat light, easydrinking brew would like this coffee.\n",
      "it is okay\n",
      "okay, i am a complete coffee nut: i have even been known to grow my own beans, and when i run out of my private label, i tend to enjoy the baddest kona or jamaican blue mountain i can find.br br still, sometimes i just want a quick cup of respectable coffee without all the fuss, and this is what i was hoping for in the melitta riviera decaf. to a good degree, i was happy with it, but it is certainly not something i would curl up with when in the mood for a really outstanding cup of coffee.br br the positives are the aroma, the uniformity of the grind and the overall taste, which i would rate as fairly mild and maybe a slight bit on the acid side. i found i liked it best either in a french press or in my viviano espresso maker  two techniques that make the most out of somewhat weak coffee. brewed conventionally, i found i could compensate by using somewhat more coffee than usual.br br still, although not a serious competitor to the worlds best coffees, it does not cost 50 a pound, either. i would have to say that for the price, it is definitely worth trying.\n",

      "good but not special\n",
      "first of all, when i opened my bag of melitta decaf, it did not have that strong, amazing rich coffee smell that my usual coffee has.  i brewed up a pot in my drip coffeemaker, and while it was ok, there was nothing outstanding about the taste.  it was bland and unremarkable compared to the coffee i normally drink.\n",

      "another good product from melitta\n",
      "i am a coffee fan who drinks my coffee black; nothing is added to alter the flavor of the coffee. as a result of this habit i find myself somewhat more critical of how a coffee tastes. as a general rule i prefer an arabica bean but i could not find a reference to bean type on the bag. curious i checked their web site and found they use the arabica bean exclusively.br br on the front of the bag there is reference to the process used to decaffeinate the rivera sunset coffee; the swiss water process is used. their web site provides a detailed explanation of this process which involves the removal of water soluble caffeine: unroasted coffee beans are immersed in heated water for several hours to remove the watersoluble caffeine present in the beans, as well as those coffee components that easily dissolve in water. the water is then drained from the beans and filtered or processed to remove the caffeine from the water. this decaffeinated water is then reintroduced to the coffee beans, allowing the flavor and aroma components to be absorbed by the coffee. finally, the coffee is dried and ready for roasting.br br more information is provided on the web site concerning the bean growing and selection process; i found the web site to be user friendly and well thought out.br br another habit of mine is the use of distilled water to brew coffee; i have found that public water supplies can provide water with a multitude of different tastes which can negatively influence the flavor of the coffee.br br let me finally mention the flavor of the coffee itself. first it is very smooth and rich; i almost never have more than one cup of coffee at a time but found myself thinking more would be nice. that is very rare! the coffee had a delicate fruity flavor which i found pleasing.br br i did face one challenge with this coffee; the bag was very difficult to open without tearing it. after working on it for several minutes, i had decided i was not going to let a bag beat me, i discovered that i was able to open it be starting at the end where the bag was folded back. once i got my finger inside the bag the rest came comparatively easy. fortunately the two small tears i made in the bag were high enough to fold under when the bag was closed. the bag recommends storage in a refrigerator.br br this coffee is pleasant and refreshing and i have enjoyed drinking it; if you are a coffee lover you owe it to yourself to give this coffee a try and see what you think. i hope you are as pleased with it as i am!\n",
      "one of the best decaffeninated coffees i have tasted\n",
      "ok i have to admit i was a huge sb fan you know, that big stellarmoney coffee chain on every corner. i did not expect much from a coffee ordered online, but i take any thoughts back after the first sip of this smooth, rich coffee. there is none of the gritty, acidic after taste of other coffees; but instead a blooming, silky flavor of nuts, mocha, and pure coffee. mind you, this is not a flavored coffee, it has all of these nuances built into the riviera sunset decaf blend. oh did i forget to mention it is decaf? i could not believe it myself when i looked at the bag the second day! i thought it was true, caffinated coffee by the flavor alone, though i did notice the lack of energizing as would any decaf. highly recommended... and i am switching!\n",
      "better than that galaxymoney chain coffee\n",
      "this coffee has a more present flavor than the stuff they brew for us at work, yet it goes down smoothly. to my wife and i, that is a good combination. the fact that it comes already ground does not do anything to subtract the flavor either.\n",

      "some reviewers say the coffee is bitter i like bitter but i did not like this. it was not a good bitter taste, it was a cringe kind of taste.br br i drink one of the strongest coffees out there and this was too much for me. the strange taste of it turned me off...br i once owned a coffee pot by melitta too, and it took a cone shaped special filter. i was not impressed with that either.br br maybe i am just not big on arabica coffee or whatever it is but the taste was unpleasant to me. not smooth. bitter yes, but not smooth.br br it smells ok. i agree with charlie  another amazon reviewer who said the package was difficult to open. it was sealed extremely tight and when you did eventually get it open, the bag tore apart.br br no way would i spend 20 bucks for this. if i was addicted to it, possibly, but even then that is steep. and i surely will not buy this in the future.br br you can go down to the local name of popular coffee shop here and get 2 bags for this price of freshly ground coffee.br br melitta makes it sound like it is the greatest thing since sliced bread on their package. gourmet, swiss water process, from europes charming sidewalk cafes, top quality hand picked beans..br br if you want to pay this kind of money and like melitta coffee, then get it, but i do not think it is anything special.\n",
      "not impressed\n",
      "i am not a coffee snob.  i can tell that there is a difference between kenyan and columbian, but i cannot tell you which is which without a label.  this decaf tastes good.  i like mine with lots of fake sugar and cream; the coffee flavor is not subdued by these additions.  the bag ultimately required scissors to open.  the blurb for this says pack of 3; i only got one bag.  not sure why that is; it is happened before with other products.  would i buy this again?  sure, if it was on sale . . . that is how i buy my coffee most of the time.\n",

      "first off, i received a bag of this coffee via the vine program to review at no cost.  secondly, i am more of a bold, slapmeintheface french roast coffee drinker or starbucks gold coast, so i had my reservations about this decaf.br br and ... well, for me, this coffee had a somewhat stale aroma upon opening the package, an ok flavor once brewed sort of a nutty strange flavor at first, and once consumed, left an aftertaste in my mouth.br br it is definitely a different roast than i am used to, but it is decent for a preground melita decaf.  more of a medium roast as opposed to being a dark bold roast in my opinion.  overall ... not too bad.br br i give this coffee a soso recommendation.\n",

      "i remember the cool, modern melitta drip coffee makers from decades ago. a visual delight of glass and wood without a hint of plastic, they were elegantly ahead of their time. i wish i could say the same for their coffee. it is fine coffee. good, actually. however, nothing really special. i would buy it again if priced right, but probably would not go out of my way to get it, and certainly not at a gourmet price point. i must be honest and say that with the melitta name, i expected a little bit more. maybe i just got a an off batch. let us hope so.\n",

      "on an untypically cool august evening we decided to try melitta riviera sunset decaf. i heaped in too much coffee and what we got was a bitter, overly heavy cup . i know others like their coffee to curl their hair with strong taste. we like it strong but not that  much. on our next try we used less coffee and enjoyed a delightful semisweet cup of decaf. it was pleasing. those who love strong, robust, fullbodied taste ought to definitely buy melitta brand coffees.\n",

      "i usually enjoy a cup of coffee a few days a week, more as an indulgence than as a necessity.  it is a sipping beverage for me, and flavor matters a lot.  that said, i add milk and sugar, so i am not excessively picky or i think so, at least.  so i am always glad to find new gourmet blends to add to my list of favorites.br br this blend seemed promising, with a very nice aroma and a perfect, even grind.  i usually grind my own beans, but found that this grind worked nicely in my espresso machine asis.  it even produced a rich, smooth crema.  unfortunately, my first sip  without sugar or milk  was very bitter.  i ended up adding about a halfteaspoon more sugar than i usually use just to compensate.  even then, the coffee flavor, itself, was thin and weak.  with just a little milk added, it tasted more like, well, flavored milk.br br this coffee reminded me of the inoffensive bland coffee my parents used to get for our drip coffee maker a couple of decades ago.  fine for that application, but not really what i am looking for in rich, smooth flavor with low bitterness.\n",
      "nice aroma, perfect grind, bland and bitter flavor\n",
      "this coffee tastes better than folgers. that is not much of an endorsement, but since folgers is about all i ever drink, it is my only point of comparison. i would recommend you do not try the stupid and counterproductive experiment of replacing your usual caffeinated stuff with a cup of this some saturday morning, as doing so will only result in one of those headaches it takes three overthecounter painkillers to get rid of. and in the meantime, while you are trying to fight off the headache, you will be completely unable to make headway with that craptastic novel you just got from amazon, which was reinforcing all your worst opinions of the romantic fantasy subgenre before you had to lie down and commence clutching your forehead.\n",

      "if you like to have a cup of coffee after dinner with desert then this is perfect.  i love it especially for the fact that i do not feel like a live wire all night from having caffine and the flavor is amazing.  nothing like a good cup of coffee to make you feel warm and fuzzy after a wonderful dinner.br br i have tried many different coffees and have to say this one has a wonderful full flavor without the bite of some of the cheaper coffees.  melitta is a great brand and well worth the money.  i also use this to make lattes and it is great.  it is a really fine grind and great for which ever way you prefer to have you cuppa java.  you get what you pay for and this is well worth every penny.\n",

      "normally i would not purchase coffee online as i have several coffee shops within a reasonable distance.  i saw this and figured why not?br br this coffee was vacuumed sealed and was tight enough to where i had to use scissors to open it.  one thing i tend to avoid is preground coffee.  i usually like to grind my own beans as i find the taste is better.br br the smell from the bag was for a lack of better words pretty basic.  usually, there is a distinct smell depending on the bean and there can be faint traces of something.  there was not anything distinct about this coffee.br br i used a standard drip maker which in itself was probably not the best choice but i suspect it would not matter as i was surprised that there really is not a strong smell coming from the cup of coffee which i drank black.br br the taste was kind of bland.  i did try a little piece of chocolate and it did seem to help.br br overall it is an ok coffee if you are not an aficionado.  however, it is not something i would add to my list of brands i purchase.\n",

      "riviera sunset decaffinated coffee, from the melitta cafeacute; collection, is a good coffee for that first, morning cup of coffee.  it is a south american blend for those who prefer a brighter more acidic kind of brew, but is still well balanced and make s a fine cup of java.br br the coffee comes in an attractive,  black bag with a bag with the now ubiquitous air valve.  the folks at melitta know how to compact coffee for travelall ambient air was sucked out of the bag, shrinking the usual size of the 10 ounces from its expected size, to a small, dense brick.  cutting open the bag, there was an audible hiss as the bag seemed to expand to double its size.  the aroma was intoxicatingthink deep coffee with chocolate hints and with nothing acrid about it.  the bag does not indicate the level of the roast, but on inspection the coffee appears to be a darker roast somewhere between a full city and european.  the bag states that this is an extra fine grind, but on inspection it seems to be less powdery than you would want for fine espresso, and is more of a fine grind.  this, i imagine, is meant a compromise so that the coffee is suitable for both the common drip coffee machines that use a filter or could be used with an espresso machine.br br for some reason, the instructions indicate that you should use two level teaspoons for every six ounces of water.  i am not sure how they drink coffee in europe, but in the us coffee machines measure by the cup.  this leads to a bizarre 2.7 teaspoons of coffee per cup and to my taste a slightly weak cup of coffee.  in spite of the grind, i would stick with the usual 1 tablespoon per cup proportion for your drip coffee maker and work up from there.  your intuition should serve you well, and i would stick with your usual measurements i am one of those heaping tablespoon per cup guys.br br the coffee definitely shows its south american origins.  in spite of the darkness of the roast and richness of the aroma, the coffee once  brewed is more light, breakfasty, and slightly more acidic than i imagined it would be. given the type of coffee that it is, it also might have benefited from a slightly lighter roast. still, it is a well balanced south american blend.  it lacks the distinctiveness of a single origin coffee but given that it is a blend has a more rounded, less biting flavor.  although decaffeinating can sometimes sap the bold flavors of a coffee, this coffee still has a lot of personality and a distinctive taste.br br this is not for the pure coffee lover who likes a dark, earthy, and oily cup of java that can basically stand on its own.  this coffee is more for people who like to add a lot of buffera fair amount of milk and sugar or one of those torani syrups e.g. a hrefhttp:www.amazon.comgpproductb001e5e2qstorani syrup, vanilla, 25.4ounce bottles pack of 3a for a little extra flavor, for those who like those kind of things.  it also makes a great iced coffee.  if cold brewed, the coffee loses its tannic edge and is more smooth and sweet, but also loses a little personality in the process. i did not try using this in an espresso machine as i do not have one, but i do not think that it would yield a great espresso.  concentrated, i think the acidity might become overwhelming.br br all in all, this is a fine blend of coffee at a fine price.  with a little experimentation on the proportions, it yields a fine cup of breakfast coffee.\n",
      "a fine breakfast coffee for your drip coffee maker\n",
      "this coffee had two strikes against it: it was decaf, and it was already ground. i do use decaf, generally in a 5050 mix with full strength caffeinated coffee, but i always like to grind my own beans to assure freshness. still, i thought i would give this melitta coffee a shot it was free from vines, after all. i am happy to say it surpassed expectations. i made a pot without mixing it with anything and drank it black, as i always do. it is surprisingly drinkable, if a little on the light side. still, the taste is fairly rich and appealingly winey, though i do like a little more smoky aftertaste than this provides. there is really not much aftertaste at all, truth be told. it is as good if not better than nearly all the straight decaf coffee i have ever had, and having it ground as opposed to beans really does not seem to be an issue here. ground coffee does tend to go stale more quickly than bean, so i would suggest using it fairly quickly, but that is easy to do with a 10ounce bag. if you are a decaf drinker and prefer not to have to grind beans, i would highly recommend this brand...\n",
      "had my doubts, but i am impressed...\n",
      "the initial aroma upon opening the package was decent, though subtle. unfortunately, it quickly dissipated  i really could not smell anything after a minute, which i assume is due to it being preground.br br i brewed this coffee in a french press as well as in a drip brewer. both results tasted flat and boring, although there was a decent amount of body  at least it was inoffensive. perhaps a notch up from bad diner coffee. for about the same price, you could get better tasting fresher beans from a cafe or natural foods store.\n",
      "meh\n",
      "i am amazed at the consistent flavor of melitta coffees. seriously, i sip any melitta coffee and can identify it immediately as they all taste the same. not bad coffee, always a darker roast and a deep flavor, but always the same no matter what flavor is printed on the package. the riviera sunset makes a nice rich cup of decaf coffee, perfect for an after dinner treat.\n",

      "i have had to cut back on caffeine recently because of heart palpitations that seemed to be made worse by all the coffee i drink 5 cups a day, maybe. so i am mixing 13 melitta colombian and 23 decaf. i substituted this for the other decaf i have been drinking and found that it has a rich smooth taste. very little to none of the burnt taste that decaf often has. the price on amazon makes it a pretty good buy as well. i do not care for the packaging, however. i could not get it open without cutting the top, and then i had to transfer it to an old coffee can to store it, with all the mess that that entails. if it were in a can, i would be more inclined to buy it. but the taste for a decaf is quite good.\n",
      "rich smooth taste\n",
      "i am surprised how much it tastes like coffee. to be completely accurate, it tastes like a watered down coffee like the kind you get at hotels with hazelnut flavor  and a very slight earthy undertone. if someone gave me a sip and did not tell me what it was, i would think it were coffee, let us put it that way.br br there is not all that much root per teabag though, and since i like strong coffee i only use 6 oz of water per bag and steep it covered for 15 mins. then with some cream and sugar it is quite good.br br as for the liver tonic claim, well dandelion stimulates bile flow and supposedly helps clear out some stuff gunking up the liver. i do not know about that yet, but so far i have not noticed any ill effects from drinking this. i feel fine, if not outright good after drinking a cup, but that is as far as i can confirm the effects.br br and with even decaf coffee containing 515 mg caffeine per serving, this stuff being completely caffeine free is a blessing for those of us who go bananas and light public property on fire when we get the slightest bit of caffeine. anyone who needs a coffee substitute, do give this a try.\n",

      "i have a 11 yr old pomimo 12 pomeranian, 12 american eskimo who seems to only like human food. although i would love to give him human food all the time, i know it is not good for his digestive system, and it does not have the proper nutrients required for a dog, especially at his current age. upon trying various brands including blue and call of the wild, i could not justify the price in comparison to how little my dog liked the taste. after reading some positive reviews here on amazon for newmans, i decided to give it a go. surprisingly, my dog started eating the food immediately after i poured some into his dish. he never does that with other dry dog food, and usually waits to eat after i have given him a nibble of everything that i eat during the day. what makes it even better is the reasonable price for the quality. yes, i understand that organic and quality usmade food are naturally more expensive, however some of the brands charge double of newmans and provide only half the taste. as humans, we are usually sold by the nutritious  wholesome advertisements when buying dog food, however i think its pretty important for my dog to actually like the taste of the food also. newmans seems to be the ticket for both nutrition and taste. will be buying newmans as a regular!\n",

      "i originally bought this as a replacement for science diets id as it was always much more expensive than anything else out there. id was also more expensive than newmans at my local vets office. i have had a ton of issues getting my dog to accept other dog foods in the past. we tried pretty much every brand that you can buy in pet shops and always had problems with my dog scratching or having her ears get bright red. we found out the problem after one of the cases where she almost went into renal failure after eating her milkbone treats. we needed something organic without a lot of beef in it. while this one does have some biproduct for protein, it does not seem to bother my dog at all. she also has normal stools every time which was not the case even with the id. my dog hated the id. she would often leave a good portion of it on the ground or in the bowl and rarely ate it in its entirety. with the newmans own it is night and day. she scarfs it down in less than a couple minutes and usually eats a bowl in one sitting. it seems like she loves it from the way she eats it.br br a couple of the reports from reviewers originally scared me about the reports of scratching which was exactly the problem i had with other dog foods. i gave it a try and my husky has never had a problem since and she has been on it for almost three months now. my husky has always had problems with digestive issues and this seems to be one dog food that she likes and does not have problems with.br br on a side note, i wish newmans offered a bigger size bag. i have to order these all the time due to the 12.5 pound bag. my husky kills a bag in roughly two weeks due to her size. it still works out being cheaper than the 50 bag of 17 pound id i was ordering so i am still happy with it. science diet was sending me to the poor house.\n",

      "i have suffered from recurrent bouts of acute sinusitis that have only become worse and worse over the years. every time i get an infection, my right maxillary sinus swells up like a balloon. sleeping at night on account of this condition is terribly difficult; i often have to resort to using afrin to decongest my sinuses, which is effective but also very painful and not a realistic, long term solution because of rebound congestion. now i already irrigate with a motorized system, often upwards of 810x daily when i am sick, and drinking herbal tea has also become a pasttime to help cope with my sinus disease. that being said, i bought this tea out of sheer desperation. i will try and have tried next to anything to give myself some relief while i wait for antibiotics to take effect. the only thing which i find works even close to as well as afrin is to megadose on psuedoephedrine 240 12 times per day, which is something that is also unsustainable. so, keep in mind that the severity of my sinus condition is drastic. what i found with this tea is that it seems to help, but i cannot tell whether or not it works any better than domestic teas that tout similar claims yogis breathe deep and cold buster, celestial sleepytime sinus soother, and other respiratoryaiding herbal formulations. i have brewed it doublestrong to try and gain the greatest effect, and again, it seems to work modestly but nothing amazing. the taste is a little bitter, but i suppose that is a fairly reasonable indicator it has beneficial compounds in it. all in all, i am likely to stick with the less exotic teas that i can buy at the grocery store. as an aside, i find celestials sweet and spicy herbal mix to have probably the best mucus thinning effect out of all the teas i have tried, though it is not at all marketed as something for this purpose. if you read everything they put in it, though, it makes sense that it would help.\n",

      "enfamil premium lipil formula is the same as the previous flagship mead johnson formulaenfamil lipilexcept that it has prebiotics added in.  our son was on enfamil lipil from september 2007september 2008.  he was breastfed and formula fed during this time.  our daughter, who is due in january 2010, will also be breastfed and formula fed for her first year of life.  we tried two other formulas with our sonsimilac advance and parents choice.  the similac was fine but clumped badly.  during the time we experimented with the parents choice formula, my son was consistently troubled by colds and the flu.  i think the parents choice formula lowered his immunity somehow and will never use it again.  i believe that mead johnsons decision to use prebiotics is a good one.  our son had colicacid reflux in part because his digestive system was not yet populated with the good bacteria for breaking down milk proteins.  he was a lot more comfortable after we started putting a little culturelle a probiotic in his formula in the evening.  and since a lot of our immune system is in our digestive tract, he had fewer sick days after introducing the culturelle.  probiotics and prebiotics will also help infants rebound from the negative effects of antibiotics like amoxicillin quicker.br br regarding the bpa found in formula can liners, i talked to an enfamil customer service representative who told me that mead johnson now uses cans that are lined with a modified polyester that is bpa free.  similac advance earlyshield comes in a bpafree can also the simplepac container.br br another concern parents have is the cost of formula.  name brand formulas are expensive!  but if you think about it, you are feeding a human being for about 15 a week a can usually lasts us 1.5 to 2 weeks.  15 a week is peanuts compared to what a hungry teenager devours!  and with name brand formulas you are getting the absolute best product availablebill gates could not buy a better formula than what is on the shelves at target or walmart.br br if you are a new parent and feel overwhelmed by the infant formula section of your grocery store as i was in september 2007, i suggest starting with the flagship formula of either mead johnson enfamil premium lipil, abbott laboratories similac advance earlyshield, or nestle good start gentle plus or good start protect plus.  they are all excellent infant formulas.  you just have to see what works for you and your baby.\n",

      "this is the best cajun spice my wife and i have found anywhere, ever.  we have been using it for more than ten years.  it goes great on all sorts of things  chicken, beef, pork, fish, eggs hard boiled, scrambled, or fried, baked potato, etc.  not only is it a very good combination of spices, it is also ground fine and mixed well.  whenever we fry something in batter or breading, luziannes cajun seasoning usually finds its way into the mix.br br we have tried slap ya momma and other cajun spices, but those tend to be too coarse.  instead of tasting a blend of spices, you tend to bite down on a nugget of salt, filling your mouth with the taste of salt, then a nugget of pepper, filling your mouth with the taste of pepper, etc.  luziannes is definitely the superior implementation.br br we recently ran out of it, and to our dismay safeway has stopped carrying this product, which is why we have tried other brands.  none have measured up, which is why i was searching for it online.  we are very happy to have found it again on amazon.\n",

      "this product which i am not allowed to return has ingrediants of salt, spices, hydrolysed soy protein, that last item is the common industry con for adding msg to your food. every soup on your grocers shelf contains msg, but, i digress. so, the third ingrediant is a form of msg, further down the ingrediant list is proudly displayed ... monosodium gludamate, ...msg. this does not add spice to your food, it stimulats your tongue into feeling that the food tastes good, when it does not. msg can make dogfood taste like hamburger. anyone who thinks this is making their food taste cajun may be serving alpo.  tones and durkee sp do not contain msg, i prefer tones!br br i have 8 eight ounce cans of this stuff.. would anybody like to buy some hamburger from me?\n",

      "i bought this seasoning because amazon stopped selling the 12 count konriko cajun seasoning so this was the one they had in a 12 count.  i bought it thinking it would be similar to the konriko, boy was i wrong!!!br br first of all like another reviewer said some of the ingredients are as follows:  hydrolyzed soy protein, and partially hydrogenated cottonseed and soy bean oil.  i was completely stumped as to why these two ingredients were necessary in a spice blend mix.  now i know why with the hydrolyzed soy protein; as the other reviewer stated it is a industry way of adding msg.  well why in the world do we need that and what is up with the hydrogenated soy bean and cottonseed oil!!!!  beside it being bad for your health it causes the product to cake and clump.  i steer clear of products with hydrogenated oils in them.  an even though this may not have many trans fat an accumulation over time is what makes this deceptively bad for your health.  when i purchased this last year they did not have the ingredients listed in the description, now it is.  i think that amazon as a regular practice should require all food productscompanys to list the ingredients of their product to sell on their site.  why wait until the customer purchase it to find out???!!!  i do not think this is a customer friendly practice!!!!br br not a good buy imo.  i found my konriko at another site and will be purchasing it from there; unless amazon brings it back at a 12 count offer; otherwise to buy one at 8 and 4.99 sh is just way over priced and highway robbery!!!!\n",

      "we discovered earths best when my oldest started solids years ago.  they had a more limited selection then, but offered more variety than the regular brands.  for him, we only bought a few jars each trip, those flavors that we could not get in another brand.  for our second child, we added a few more.  with the 3rd baby, we started out on the larger brands, but he would not eat them.  who can blame him!?  they are runny and lacking any flavor.  not to mention, no matter how good sweet potatoes are, how many jars can you eat?  he gobbles up every jar of earths best without any problems.  when we introduce a new flavor, he is all for it.br br i agree with other posts that some of the flavors are very runny.  we just add a few tsp. of cereal and problem solved.br br earths best is more expensive.  i calculated that every 2 weeks of food costs me 15 more than buying the other brands.  however, we decided that since he eats it all vs. being very picky with other brands it is a wash.br br if you want to use earths best for your baby wout breaking the bank, try these tips:br visit earths bests website and print off all the coupons they will allow usually 3, have family and friends do the samebr br buy at whole foods.  they have good prices and when you buy a lot, they give you a bulk discountbr br you can also buy them by the case at meijers for less than 10.00, cheaper than here!\n",

      "according to a lot of reviews on top baby food brands overall, earths best was always voted to be in the top 5 of all the lists of reviews by mom links, consumer reports, livestrong, baby health sites.  here is a excerpt from one of the sites i think it was from ehow.com:br br the center for science in the public interest evaluated popular brands of baby foods, including gerbers, heinz, earths best and beechnut. according to the centers report, earths best did not use starchy fillers or replace real food with water and thickening agents in many of their products for children over six months of age. such adulterated products are nutritionally inferior to products made with more fruits and vegetables. earths best uses certified organic products. the brand offers singleingredient, smooth foods for infants over four months; fruit, vegetable, grain and meat blends for babies over six months; and a variety of chunky soups, dinners and vegetable medleys for children over nine months old. earths best products are sold at supermarkets, natural food stores and big box stores nationwide.br br plus, my baby girl loves it.  yes, it might be a little runnier than the other baby foods, but i just add a little rice with it and that fixes it.\n",

      "organic foods are probably most important the first couple of years of life. that is when so much brain development is happening that trying to keep as much pesticides as possible away from your childs developing brain and body is a very worthy goal.br br fortunately it is a little easier than it is for a grown up. with our more varied foods and time constraints and on the go, etc. also no matter how worthy a goal, your child has to eat the food. this is an excellent combination of flavors that i was not always able to find at local stores. and with subscribe and save it is cheaper and delivered to my door.br br the flavors are vegetable turkey which lists the ingredients as water, organic carrots, organic apples, organic ground turkey, organic whole barley flour.br br sweet potato and chicken: water, organic sweet potatoes, organic apricot puree, mechanically separated organic chicken, organic brown rice flour.br br summer vegetable: water, organic corn, organic zucchini, organic green beans, organic brown rice, organic carrots, organic garbanzo beans, organic canola oil.br br rice and lentil: water, organic apples, organic carrots, organic brown rice, organic lentils, organic canola oilbr br there are other earth best blends where water is not the number one ingredient. obviously that somewhat calls into the question the value of this particular earths best item. i just found the tomato and carrot one which i have ordered but not received yet.  also if you put in organic baby food in amazon search there are some brands with just food in them for example peter rabbit organics have not yet tried it, but might when she is a bit older.br br overall though i do recommend this variety pack. our daughter likes them all and she is getting organic ingredients. and for a decent price, even considering the amount of water in them. the water being first in all 4 is giving me pause as to the overall value and definitely something i will keep in mind as to trying other brands going forward. the ingredient lists are all directly from the earth bests website, earthsbest.com,  as i do not have the products in front of my right now.\n",

      "as i have with all other earths best jarred baby food, i will not be purchasing these dinners for my baby because the jar lids contain bpa.  i contacted earths bests consumer relations dept. personally, and the representative read me a prepared statement saying that the epoxy resin that lines earths best baby food jar lids contains trace amounts of bpa, but it does not come into direct contact with the food.  that kind of lukewarm response was not enough to put my concerns about bpa to rest ... after all, packaged food is jostledaround so much during shipping that these jars could spend days upside down, with the food resting directly on the jar lids.  so i guess i will have to pass on these jarred dinners for now.  the earths best rep did say that they were doing accelerated testing of bpafree alternatives for lining their baby food jars.br br this is such a shame, because earths best is the only company that makes organic, prepackaged stage 2 complete meals e.g., with meatprotein, veggies  carbsstarch in puree form.  all the other organic baby food manufacturers, such as plum, sprout, ellas kitchen, etc., only make stage 3 meals, in chunky form.  earths best does make some baby food in bpafree squeeze pouches, but that does not include its dinner line.  i was hoping to be able to expose my littleone to a wider variety of flavors and wellbalanced meals while still at the puree stage.  but i guess i will have to wait until she is old enough for stage 3 chunky meals, or make her baby food myself.  virtually impossible for this superbusy and domesticallychallenged mom, lol!\n",

      "i found this tea when i explored a local grocery store on the north shore of oahu on a trip to hawaii last summer. every now  then i like to add cream to my tea so the idea of a milk tea was not totally bizarre. how you would guess i am american? i enjoy white, black, flavored  herbal teas but am not a fan of most floral blends.br br i did not know what to expect when the package said the ingredients included black tea, nondairy creamer, rosehip extract  refined sugar. i have never considered putting nondairy creamer into tea. would it be a mess i dumped into the mug  stirred to death? instead, i found all the ingredients in an oversized traditional paper tea bag held in a foillike moisture proof package.br br after steeping 3mins, i was thrilled to discover a lightflavored cup of tea, slightly fruityscented, with a soothing feel to it and no floral tones to the taste. and no stirring, no clump at the bottom of the cup.br br a year later i found one of the packages in my luggage  found it just as tasty  easy to prepare as last year. i went online to buy some more  was thrilled to find that amazon offered the same item  a couple of other flavors by the same company too!\n",

      "i purchased some of this special habanero sauce this past year for my super bowl party. it was a hit! i thought i would try the mild since i like some zing, but did not want to burn my mouth off. it was a great mix of some spicy zing with a sweet overtone. went great with chips as a dip, as well as really good with as a dipping sauce with chicken wings.br br i am thinking about using this as a glaze as well for an upcoming pork tenderloin. i think this sauce is a great change of pace from the person who is sick of the same tastes that you get from the same stuff in the local grocery stores. plus it is from a small business.....win win win!br br thanks again everidae sauce for a great change of pace!\n",
      "a change of pace!\n",
      "mild everidae sauce is like a condiment. it goes on everything and does not take over the flavor of the food but enhances it. i use this sauce on burgers, shredded pork, grilled chicken, baked chicken, eggs, as a pizza sauce substitute, and basically anything. my kids love the mild kick and flavorful enhancement of the mild sauce. my 10 and 6 year old put it on everything and rave! it will change your cooking and challenge you to try it on everything!\n",
      "enjoyed by the whole family!\n",
      "so i have sampled and bought my fair share of everidae sauce and i have to say without a doubt it is the next best thing to put on food.  i will start off by saying i do know the maker of this sauce, and although that may seem like this review is a bit biased, i wanted to be the first to formally state the flavorful blend of this sauce can literally go on everything.br br i like spicy hotness, and unlike other condiments like franks red hot, this does not mask the flavor of the food but adds to it.br i have used this sauce on hotdogs, hamburgers, chicken, tacos, and eggs.br br the mild is a little bit sweeter than the medium and hotthe hot being the heat that i particularly enjoy.  but this stuff can be added to almost any sauce or family recipe to give it that extra kick of spicy sweetness that will make your mouth water.\n",

      "i have been a huge fan of jelly bellys since i was a kid, which was about 25 years ago.  i have always had a favorite.  at first it was peach, then banana.  juicy pear came along and that was my favorite for about ten years.  i thought nothing would top it, ever.  then i tried red apple.  it is sweet and tart and really delicious, my new favorite flavor.  a ten pound box is surprisingly tempting and i am sorry they are currently all sold out.\n",
      "my favorite jelly belly flavor\n",
      "i was not sure what to expect from this jelly belly flavor. i have eaten red apples before but they were usually in a fruit. this was a candied bean with red apple flavors put inside. despite the obvious witchcrafts, i tried this confection because i am not afraid of the unknown like so many people in the religious right wrong. i was surprised to find that this red apple had a delicious applelike flavor and a chew not unlike a finely prepared hamsteak. would i eat more of these? yes, i would. i would also recommend this red apple to anybody who is adventurous and wants to experience a new and exciting way to feel the best parts of the fruit eating process. red apple jelly beans, they do taste like apples kind of but not completely. still pretty good.\n",

      "latest updatebr br we are now past the baby food stage so i may have missed this if it was formally announced, but i recently heard that they switched packaging in late 2011 to be completely bpa free.  i confirmed this with customer service.  leaving the remaining review as it was...br br br br my wife had made her own baby food for our daughter for the first eight months.  then, when our daughter was going to begin daycare, there was a certain convenience factor of being about to send in jars of baby food for her and so we bought earths best.  it was organic, and figured to be the closest bought brand to what she had been making herself.  the variety packs are a nice, easy way to stock different kinds for our baby to enjoy...  and enjoy she did for several of the flavors, though some she hated as well.  all in all, we were pleased, and baby seemed pleased.br br needless to say, i was pretty surprised to read the review about bpa in the lids.  i spent some time trying to verify this myself.  a lot of different blogs stated it, and while i could not find anything definitive, here is what bothered me:  clearly earths best knows people are concerned about bpa in their lids...  their own facebook site is littered with people asking this same question.  the admin answers these the same way... food safety and baby health is of the highest priority, call us to discuss.  that is only slightly paraphrased.  going to their website, they have zero articles on bpa and none in the faqs section either...  nothing.  i am not worried enough about the issue to stop using what we purchased, but i would have felt a whole lot better about the company and their products if they would acknowledge parents concerns and tell parents...  something.  hey, we check our food in laboratory testing regularly and the the amount of bpa found in our food is x, which is so low, there are no health concerns...  just say something...  anything.  do you really want the onus on the customer to contact you to keep using your product?br br as i was taking the time to review their product, i decided i would call them to give them a fair chance to explain.  something, i likely would not have done if i was not writing a review.  their office was closed...  9am  7pm est.  not the most convenient times for a working parent, but i will attempt to follow up and update this accordingly.br br updated oldbr just spoke to someone from customer service.  she says that the liner that comes into contact with the food is bpa free, but that there is another section of the lid behind this liner, that does contain bpa, but that section of the lid does not come in contact with the food.  i am sure not everyone will be okay with that answer, but i am ok with it.  i still think it should be an answer that is readily available to consumers without calling them, but i will say there was no hold time at least.\n",
      "bpa no longer an issue\n",
      "here is the response i got to my emailed question about bpa in the lids of their glass jars:br br while all of our earths best foods were and are safe; earths best organic jarred baby food was converted to packaging that does not use bpa in october, 2011.br br that satisfies my concerns. they include a 1800 number if people have further questions: please feel free to contact us at 18004344246, monday through friday from 7am  5pm mountain time.br br i do not know why they do not advertise this on the packaging, website, etc. it would reassure a lot of parents!\n",
      "now bpa free, according to earths best\n",
      "i have been very pleased with this variety pack of baby food. the pack contains three each of pears, peaches oatmeal banana, apples and apricots, and peaches bananas and raspberries. my 6 12 month old daughter loves all of them, especially the peaches bananas and raspberries! i have been very satisfied with earths best with one exception. the metal lids have a lining that contains bpa as do all lids on glass babyfood jars, so if you are set on staying away from bpa, you will want to get your baby food from companies that make pouches, like happybaby and plum organics. i make a lot of my own babyfood, so i feel that feeding her some food from glass jars is acceptable, especially for varieties that i cannot make. i do also buy a lot of happybaby, and i am very satisfied with the quality there also. all in all though, a very nice variety of good tasting fruits!\n",

      "i was disappointed to find out that the lids of earths best jarred foods are coated with an epoxy lining that contains bpa :br i thought i was avoiding the whole bpa issue because these are in glass rather than plastic containers. if it is in the lids, it is going to get in the food as the food moves around in the jar during packaging, shipping, storage, etc. i was planning on being a devoted earths best jarred food user because it was organic and in glass, but then i found out about the bpa. as a note, if bpa does not bother you, most of earths best food is tasty.\n",

      "earths best baby foodbr my favorite brand of baby food by far. both my son who is now over 2 years old and my daughter now almost one have used a wide variety of foods from earths best. i am a huge proponent of feeding children primarily organic andor locally grown foods to promote proper nutrition and growth. but i do not feel that all organic brands are equal. i have tried many varieties including store brands and others only available through internet purchase and found that earths best is by far the best for your money.br br fruit variety packbr normally i would say this is a great idea, but i was not a fan of this particular variety. my son would have been just fine with it, but unfortunately for us at this point my daughter is allergic to raspberries and mangos. these are both things i think she will grown out of, but something you may want to consider when purchasing this item. i would suggest trying an individual serving of one from your local store to see if your child has an allergy, but if they do not i would say buy it! other than that i do think it is a great variety for kids who need some changing up occasionally. also, the subscription price on this variety is great and can be altered depending on how soon you need it. we ended up running through another subscription we had and were able to have another shipped as soon as we needed it.\n",
      "best baby food by far, but we have some allergies with this one.\n",
      "just off the phone with them aug12 and they said that yes they stopped putting bpa in the liners in oct11. of course there is old stock on the shelves so i asked how to tell whether the liners we have are the old with bpa or the new without bpa and the person there said to look at the inside the surface of the lid. if it is all white then it is bpa free  if it is metallic or gold then it is the old lids which did contain a bpa layer. thought this might help some of you out there!\n",

      "this was a good buy. the variety is still close enough so i did not have to worry if baby will like the next one\n",
      "good buy\n",
      "i am a strong believer in giving my baby organic foods as much as possible. we used many of the earths best flavors and baby really enjoyed most of them. what i found irritating though was how runny many of the flavors were; i often had to add oatmeal or rice just to keep the food on the spoon.  water is added to many if not most of the flavors. i wondered if that was a necessity however plum ellas kitchen and happy baby brands also organic do not have water as an added ingredient. we definitely used these, but to be honest, i prefered the other brands because i felt we were getting a better value considering we were not paying for water in those packages.\n",
      "added water\n",
      "i am not the one who eats these so i cannot give the best review but my son gobbles them up so i will take that as a 5 star rating from him and i give it 5 stars since i know it is organic and i do not have to worry about what he is eating.  now if i were to review his vegetables i might have to deduct a star for him but that is just because he does not seem to care for peas much.\n",
      "great for moms on the go\n",
      "with the amazon mom discount, this is cheaper than in stores unless there is a sale.  it regularly goes on sale at kroger, publix, and other grocery stores for around 50 cents a jar.  i wish there were other earths best fruit varieties available on amazon at this price.  no problems with breakage during shipping for me, but i found the packaging annoying.  in general though, i think earths best is a good brand and that the price is fair for what you are getting:  organic, nongmo baby food delivered to your door step!  as a single mom in a rural community, going to the grocery store with the baby can be such a hassle.br br earths best is definitely better tasting and smelling than nonorganic foods like gerber.  the textures are good, but i had to stay on 1st foods longer than six months because the textures of almost all 2nd foods made my son gag.  i had a similar issue graduating from 2nd foods to 3rd foods.  sprout baby food, however, is the best quality i have tried for freshness, aroma, and taste.  it reminds me of pureed fresh produce.  while i have seen it in winndixie for the same price as earths best, it is much more expensive on amazon and the selection of flavors is relatively limited both in stores and online.  i am going to start making my own organic baby food and freezing it, but i will probably always keep a few jars of earths best to get by in a pinch.\n",
