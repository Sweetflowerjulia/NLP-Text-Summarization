      "You may laugh, but I have found that Otherland volumes 1-4 are poor at picking up debris around the house.  I once spilled some cornflakes on the floor, and foolishly thought that I could clean it up by dropping &#34;City of Golden Shadows&#34; on it.  Not only did it not clean, it managed to make things worse by fragmenting the cornflakes into smaller and smaller pieces.  I did what any normal person would do: I stacked the other books on top, hoping that the combined power would whisk the cornflakes away to the technological wonderland that is Otherland.  No such results.Bin Otherland Empty, on the other hand, works like magic.  If you hook it up to a powerful enough motor, you can banish those cornflakes to the land of wind and ghosts.  The downside is that it's pretty light reading, but given the young adult trend these days it's following the light reading trend that literature is headed for these days.It's recommended that you get through the previous volume though (&#34;Hoover Electrical Vaccum Unit&#34;).  I mean, Bin Otherland Empty does work as a stand-alone, but it's not quite as absorbing when not paired up with the prequel.  Some people think you can skip the previous volume and lust stick your mouth in at one end and suck, but, c'mon, that's just gross.Spoiler alert!  Cornflakes vaccumed up.\n",

I come to this topic from both a Christian background and intellectual skepticism. But in the past fifteen years I have been exposed to and come to see the value of several forms of oracle and divination as tools for tapping into the subconscious as well as whatever one chooses to believe about the unseen energies and spirits possibly involved. I have often experienced remarkable outcomes and guidance from Runes, I Ching, and various forms of Tarot Cards, and have come to trust and value my own gifts of intuition. It was exciting to see what I have experienced with \"divination\" and oracle tools so well summed up and explained.This is an attractively laid-out, beautifully illustrated book that is impressively distinct from many coffee-table type overview \"encyclopedias\" on various subjects for actually having something useful and insightful to say. So many of these type of books are rushed into print to take advantage of popular (and superficial) interest in a given subject and are mostly cheap eye candy with shallow content and often misinformation. What impressed me most about this book is the author\\'s knowledgeable and balanced presentation. He is not dismissive of religion, but he is forthright about how religion and mainstream culture have repressed alternative realities and methods throughout history. This book is not full of gushy New-Age-speak.

It is not Orwell or Huxley, so expecting the writing to fly off the page and create a vivid, disturbing world is completely unrealistic. That said, the writing was oftentimes slightly disappointing when compared with the other novels.Getting immersed in the novel is troublesome: it is halting and stuttering for the first half. Roth seems to have lost her rhythm and keeps throwing the exact same obstacle at her characters disguised as different problems (A rebellion here... a rebellion here... a rebellion here... a rebellion here... it is an interesting look into a country that's collapsing, but it becomes quite too predictable).As interesting as it was stylistically to switch chapters between Tris and Tobias's point of views, that creates a disjoint: there is none of the continuity of the first two books. Once you're immersed in Tris's narrative, her chapter ends, and suddenly you are forced to remove yourself from her brain and try to enter Tobias's head. Also, the style of voice for each character isn't quite differentiated enough to really allow this separation to fully take place. There were times when I would forget whose head I was in, and it was simply because the style did not change enough to move me from one to another.However, having finished the book, the conceit makes more sense. We had to have a look into Tobias's head.As for those who disparage Roth for ending it the way she did, I, too, was disappointed. Yet Tris always did things true to her character: things she had done in the first book and in the second. There was no other way for Roth to end the series and have Tris remain an authentic person. Sure, we all want a happy ending, but doing so would be a cop out. How likely would it be for a sixteen year old girl to survive all of the things Tris has survived? Not very. Add that to her self-sacrificing tendencies and what you get is exactly what Roth wrote. Was I angry? Yes. Heartbroken? Definitely? Did I spend the last eighty pages or so of the book crying, wiping my eyes, aware of what was going to happen? Yeah. But then again, I'm a writer, and as a writer, I would have been extremely frustrated if Roth had ended it happily for everyone. That's simply not realistic.So while I am sad that I didn't get the storybook ending a la The Hunger Games or Harry Potter, I am happy that, for once, an author was realistic about what would happen to a traumatized sixteen year old girl in extraordinary circumstances who has survived way longer than probable.\", 'overall': 4.0, 'summary': 'What did you expect?', 'unixReviewTime': 1382572800, 'reviewTime': '10 24, 2013'}\n"

No. There's an interval and then there's a second act, and then there's the end. So okay, this story has more than 2 acts. By the end it will have, maybe, 7. So it's not really fair to say 'these characters aren't important' or 'this was just a bridge' or 'we didn't get to the end' ...  because until we do reach the end, we can't tell.I believe Martin is the single greatest fantasy writer of our time. I think he will go down in history as one of the greatest, full stop. Was I frustrated at the long time between books 3 and 4? You'd better believe it. Am I sorry that some of my favourite characters didn't appear in Feast? Yes. I'm desperate to know what's happening with Tyrion. But that's what I get for not waiting till the completion of the series. I'm reading it in installments and not all my questions will be answered right away. One possible explanation for people's dissatisfaction is that this isn't a 'complete' novel the way books 1-3 are ... it is a single entity split in two. Is that a fault? Perhaps, but I'm not upset by it.Martin has spent 30 years honing his craft and perfecting his narrative skills, and I believe we as readers are reaping the benefits. I loved this book, and I eagerly look forward to the next part of the story.

I think the construction is almost flawless. The prose is gorgeous, but without sacrificing the suspense.  The book lagged only the tiniest bit toward the end, then picked up again for a magnificent final confrontation.  It also manages to be horrifying without ever feeling like sleazy horror, an amazing feat in itself.

Her strange sensitivity to light, and seeming ability to communicate with the family dog, are secondary concerns to the kids at her middle school who tease her for having an absent father. Despite gaining herself the nickname \"freaky Fern,\" she leads a generally happy life, thanks to her mother\\'s caring and her twinbrother Sam\\'s friendship.But one day in the middle of English, Fern simply disappears. No one can find her; no one has seen her leave the room, much less her desk. Unbeknownst to her classmates, Fern has somehow managed to teleport to Pirate Cove, her favorite part of a nearby beach. Frightened and unsure of how she got there, Fern tries to tell the truth, but her mother isn\\'t believing it and neither is the school\\'s headmaster. The next time she vanishes and reappears, it is to a much more dangerous location, and by then it\\'s impossible for Fern to keep her activities under wraps. It\\'s only after a series of dangerous accidents that Fern discovers the truth of her identity and the full extent of her powers as an \"otherworldly,\" the politically correct term for any creature that is not entirely human.Kogler does a wonderful job of detailing the average twelve-year-old\\'s insecurities and the way that they are magnified in Fern, who is anything but average. She presents a compelling picture of what it\\'s like to grow up different in a world where schoolchildren are cruel and ostracize people who don\\'t fit in. I found Fern, Sam, and their mother to all be very sympathetic and believable characters, whose motivations were easy to accept.I also enjoyed Kogler\\'s conception of the titular \"otherworldlies,\" which made this book refreshingly different from other vampire stories I have read. Her use of Greek myths as the starting point for a number of inhuman creatures and supernatural powers put a new spin on the traditional vampire myths.Overall, THE OTHERWORLDLIES was a satisfying read, with a plot that asked more questions than it answered but still managed to come to some kind of conclusion. Kogler\\'s left herself open for a sequel, perhaps even an entire series, about Fern\\'s future, and I for one look forward to whatever she comes up with next.Reviewed by:  Candace Cunard', 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': 'Courtesy of Teens Read Too', 'unixReviewTime': 1213920000, 'reviewTime': '06 20, 2008'}\n",

Ertle \"The Truth is Out There\"', 'helpful': [75, 101], 'reviewText': 'Well, I always thought that Good to Great was too good to be true. The author and his team picked several firms that exploded in the late 1980s compared with some selected \\'matched\\' firms that did not do well and tried to identify a set of criteria that they could identify to attribute cause to the effect (success). The problem is that with such retrospective analysis (this would be called a case-control study in clinical research) you can only identify differences and can never attribute cause and effect. These types of studies are inherently poorly resistant to biases inserted by the authors. Typically, they have a preconcieved notion of what they are looking for and then go find it in a self-fulfilling prophesy. This book is no different. The data is from public and published information like SEC reports, other published info, and interviews. The data is pretty subjective.I was wondering what happened to some of the \"great\" companies compared to the ones that were not great in the same industry (in clinical research, you would always pick two to four comparitor cases, rather than just one, to prevent bias, or to help prevent it). The reason to look was based on my glance at chart on page 2 where it was clear that the \"great\" companies were beginning to level off. Now we all know that there was a huge stock boom in the mid- to late- 1990s and that emotion and luck played as much a part in many success stories and were short lived. The book was published in 2001. What happened to those companies?So here is what I found (the first company is the \"great\" one):Walgreens traded at ~$40 in 2001 and about ~$46 now. Eckerd was purchased by J.C. Penny in 1999 while they were researching the book. Seems to be a crappy comparitor.Abbott traded at ~$46 in 2001 and about ~$42 now. Pharmacia was purchased by Pfizer in 2000 while the book was being written. Seems to be a crappy comparitor.Circuit City traded at ~$9 in 2001 and about ~$18 now. Silo went bankrupt in 1995. Seems to be a crappy comparitor.Kimberly-Clark traded at ~$65 in 2001 and about ~$60 now. Kimberly-Clark bought Scott Paper in 1995. Seems to be a crappy comparitor.Gillette traded at ~$34 in 2001 and about ~$55 now. Pfizer purchased Warner-Lambert in 2000 as the book was being written. Seems to be a crappy comparitor.Wells Fargo traded at ~$44 in 2001 and about ~$62 now. Bank of America traded at ~$20 in 2001 and about ~$45 now.Kroger traded at ~$24 in 2001 and about ~$19 now. A & P (Great A & P Tea) traded at ~$7 in 2001 and about ~$28 now.Thus, it seems that the attribution of cause and effect to the differences they found was a completely flawed methodology and probably has more complex solutions and reasons. It also shows that the authors had tremendous selection bias and compared the \"great\" firms with primarily those firms know to be doomed. Not a fair comparison. The ones that didn\\'t cease to exist seem to be doing as well to day as their \"great\" comparitors.Additionally, most of the concepts are recycled. Not bad ideas, but recycled with different jargon attributed to older ideas. The idea that leaders and managers should focus on what the firm and they do best, what they are passionate about, and what they can achieve rather than what they want to achieve is a great idea, but not new and it sure didn\\'t need to be called the hedgehog concept.', 'overall': 1.0, 'summary': 'Great until the Bubble Broke', 'unixReviewTime': 1132012800, 'reviewTime': '11 15, 2005'}\n"

Surprise!The story is told in alternating chapters: one chapter in \"the present\", where Lily (known as Lee) is working as lawyer for a conman accused of murdering one of his marks; and then one in \"the past\", that tells Lee\\'s life story, from her parents\\' marriage, her subsequent birth, up until close to the time of the present-day story. Forth and back it goes.From the get-go, there are intimations of where the conman story is going, and really it\\'s just a matter of how it plays out. Still, even despite knowing, I couldn\\'t wait to find out what happened next. The biography sections were also highly interesting. Lee isn\\'t particularly special, her life isn\\'t exceptionally dramatic-- not to say there\\'s no drama whatsoever-- yet I loved following her story.

She is a straight \"A\" student and has everything going for her. One night she and her family are on their way to their neighbor\\'s house and after dinner they decide to all go out to get some ice cream. Laurel doesn\\'t want to go and asks to go home instead. That was the last time she would see her mom, dad and little brother alive. Mr. Kaufman was the only one that survived but is now in a coma. David, Mr. and Mrs. Kaufman\\'s son had also decided not to go with them that night and just like Laurel, lived. Luckily for Laurel, her grandmother came to stay with her and took care of her, but poor David had lost his mom in the crash and his dad was in the hospital on life support and no one to help him with this tragedy. Now Laurel has to try to move on with her life and try to accept that her family is gone. The only problem is that it\\'s pretty hard when you are surrounded by things that trigger memories of the people she loved the most. Laurel keeps all her thoughts and emotions to herself and doesn\\'t let anyone know what\\'s she\\'s thinking, not even her best friend Meg.

I chose this book because I was curious to see if it was anything like Wuthering Heights (a book I rather enjoyed) writen by the other Bronte sister.Jane Eyre is a conflicted love story. It follows the life of, surprisingly, a woman named Jane. She lives a harsh childhood, first in the hands of an unloving aunt and her abusive son and then later in the confines of the deteriorating Lowood school. She resides at the school for 8 years and realizes that she wants to experience more of the world outside of the Lowood school. Jane then works as a nanny at a place called Thornfield where she falls in love with her master, Mr. Rochester.This love story is complicated and conflicted in that the love between Mr. Rochester and Jane is forbidden on more than one level.Jane Eyre was much more than I had expected. Although I enjoyed Wuthering Heights, I found Jane Eyre to be much more engaging. At many times, while reading this novel, I found myself completely frustrated yet intrigued and eager to continue at the same time. Bronte evokes such emotion in this novel, from the harsh realities of Jane's childhood to the whirlwind romance between her and her master. I found Mr. Rochester's courtship of Jane to be the most entertaining. I found Jane's confusion and reluctance to be frustrating, yet thought-provoking. And I found the separation of the two to be vexing and upsetting. Ironically, I found the ending to be strange, yet fitting in a story of constant ups and downs.

Meanwhile voters claim to express distaste for the dirt served up, yet lap it up with a voraciousness that would make Caligula blush.  \"We\\'re With Nobody\" is a scathing indictment and exposure of opposition research, but ultimately an expose without an end goal.  The authors certainly aren\\'t here to glorify the role of opposition research, nor are they calling for reforms.  Instead they are attempting to lift the veil from voters eyes.  Well written and enjoyable, \"We\\'re With Nobody\" couldn\\'t have been timed better what with this years election.', 'overall': 4.0, 'summary': 'Finding where the bodies are buried', 'unixReviewTime': 1329782400, 'reviewTime': '02 21, 2012'}\n"

The first sentence of the book, \"life is difficult,\" reflects Scott Peck\\'s idea that spiritual/mental growth must be worked towards, that human beings are generally lazy, and that growth of consciousness is a life-long process. Everything is generally working against our growth: laziness; defense mechanisms employed to maintain the status quo of mental illness over the struggle for accepting responsibility; confusion over the true nature of love; resistance to \"grace\"  (the idea of being open to our unconscious and the symbolic language of God); lack of discipline; adults being mentally and spiritually immature; poor parenting resulting in nuerosis and character disorder; and a culture that generally defends, accepts, and nurtures sickness over health.Sometimes Scott Peck\\'s language is a little heavy, but it\\'s only because he packs so much valuable information and insight into each page. The first chapter on Discipline (a tool to solve our problems. Another great Peck idea: see problems as challenges, and it is in our response to problems that life takes on its meaning and color) was a bit dry to me, but contains excellent information on delaying gratification, balancing and bracketing (attempting to listen to others/view situations with objectivity), dedication to the truth, and a key to anyone seeking to grow: ACCEPTING RESPONSIBILITY.The second section on Love was fascinating to me. Scott Peck does a great job debunking the myth of romantic love, but perhaps most valuable is the idea that real loving is about nurturing your own or another\\'s spiritual growth. Love is an action and a decision, not just a feeling. It\\'s so easy in our culture to imagine love as a feeling, red roses, wine, dinners, etc. That is the illusion of romance but has nothing to do with the work and courage of real active loving (Scott Peck says if an action doesn\\'t involve courage or work, it\\'s not loving!). Also in this chapter are a few controversial ideas, namely open marriage (Scott Peck\\'s extension of the idea that loving involves encouraging an individual\\'s total development...hmmm...sort of vague extension to me to involve plural relationships. what happened to discipline?) and even Scott Peck\\'s suggestion that he would have sex with a patient if he felt it would further both their spiritual development! (do not agree with this at all. any person in treatment is not in a position to navigate such power dynamics)The final section on Grace reminds us to look to our unconscious for information and guidance. Dreams, nagging thoughts, sudden insights, etc. from our unconscious, which Scott Peck says knows more than our conscious ever could, are signs that there is a God, and he/she/it is a loving God interested in our spiritual development (reflection of Scott Peck\\'s idea of love, and a good idea if you ask me). These signs are meant to prod us into action.In general, although at times you will be re-reading pages to make sure you got the meaning, and sometimes Scott Peck\\'s language will seem heavy and plodding, this book will help you see where you can expand the boundaries of your spirit, your mind, and your life, how you can love bigger and better (and make it mean more to everyone), how your life can have meaning and consistency, and how to be a loving, conscious person, parent, lover, mate, and friend. I underlined a LOT in this book, and going back to read just my underlines I am amazed at the amount of loving, valuable insight in this book. Growing and truly accepting responsibility for the quality of our lives is not as easy as it sounds. Scott Peck is very aware of this and gives a lot of support to keep on journeying this road less traveled.', 'overall': 4.0, 'summary': 'worth the effort', 'unixReviewTime': 1046822400, 'reviewTime': '03 5, 2003'}\n"

In a \"success\" scenario, if corn at harvesting time cost 50 cents less per unit of transaction (say, per 5000 bushels) than its cost at planting time, and the difference between contract prices (for the same amount of crop) sold and bought at planting and harvesting times, respectively, was also 50 cents, then the farmer would have made a successful hedge.There are many things one needs to know in order to become a successful commodity futures and option contract trader.  This book provides a good grounding in: knowing what a futures and an option contract is and how they\\'re different, how trading such instruments are different from, say, trading stocks, pros and cons of futures and option contract trading compared to stock trading, what goes into contract specifications, quotes, and profit and loss calculations for different commodities (e.g., delivery / expiration dates, what a trading unit represents [e.g., 1 contract of corn futures = 5000 bushels], how price movements are quoted [e.g., in cents or dollars], dollar value of each price unit movement [e.g., a penny change in corn futures contract price = $50], etc.)Adding commodities to one\\'s investment portfolio is usually thought of as a diversification strategy / opportunity.  Direct trading of commodity futures and option contracts, which in my opinion requires considerably more skills and knowledge than buying and selling mutual funds or stocks, however, is not the only way to get exposure to commodities investment or trading opportunities. Other avenues include buying and selling commodities-related mutual or exchange traded funds, or stocks of, say, commodity producing companies such as mining companies.  I\\'m not sure why the author focused on futures and option contract trading heavily in a book meant for helping beginners get started with commodities, but in my opinion, including a discussion of those other avenues would have added value to this beginners\\' book.Other types of information missing from, but could add value to, this book include:  discussion of the potential usefulness of trading simulators that help beginners get a feel for futures and option contract trading using virtual rather than real money and a sampling of the companies that provide such educational opportunities; references to other useful books or resources such as commodity-specific trade association web sites; or perhaps even a sampling of companies that provide futures and option contract trading services in addition to the author\\'s company, DeCarley Trading.An introductory book that covers more than Commodity Futures and Option Contract Trading as well as the other types of information I\\'ve mentioned above as missing from this book is Scott Frush\\'s Commodities Demystified.  Published in 2008, it\\'s a more engaging and easier read than this book but small parts of it may no longer be up to date (for example, the Top 25 Commodity Mutual Funds listing may no longer be valid); however, the concepts discussion is still valid and quite good.', 'overall': 4.0, 'summary': 'Narrowly focused on Futures and Option Contract Trading', 'unixReviewTime': 1268438400, 'reviewTime': '03 13, 2010'}\n"

With regards to their analysis of the biblical period, I was very impressed  at their genuine concern with true history rather than just relying on  scripture to provide the details. When dealing with each period, they  refrained from giving painstaking details and rather delivered a good  overview. Those wishing to satisfy their curiosity for details are able to  consult the bibliography for further reading.In Part 2, the Jewish  literature for each period is reviewed including the origin of the Torah  and an overview of Rabbinic literature such as the Talmud and  beyond.Parts 3 and 4 deal with the theory of Judaism and Jewish  practices. These are excellent for those who are being introduced to  Judaism for the very first time, or for those who could do with some  revision or brushing up on some of the important rituals, laws and  festivals.Overall, I must say this book is informative and a pleasure to  read and remains an excellent reference book.', 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': 'Comprehensive account of Jewish History and Religion', 'unixReviewTime': 962582400, 'reviewTime': '07 3, 2000'}\n",

A memoir by Ariel Dorfman, the novelist, the exile, living now with his family in Durham, North Carolina, where he holds the Walter Hines Page chair at Duke University.  To a certain extent I did like it, but the author comes over as a smarmy  busy-bee who pokes his nose into everything and inevitably gets himself  into trouble.  He sounds like a nave adolescent, full of himself, pathetic  despite his experiences and accomplishments.  He is an idealist, a quirky  character, a good writer, no doubt an eccentric.What is most incredible  is that the man now lives in the USA despite all his criticism of the  country's influence on the Third World in such books as How to Read Donald  Duck.  A bonus point for the USA for letting him stay, I'd say.  This is  not to say that Dorfman is incorrect in his assumptions though, rather it  begs the question of why did he choose to live in the US?  No doubt, it is  where he is most likely to draw attention to himself, have his books  published, and hold a secure position!  In that he's not much different to  the rest of us at heart, only differing insofar as his writing and exile is  concerned.Heading South, Looking North is an account of Dorfman's  early years in the US, his life in Chile, his involvement during the  Allende years, his struggle with language, namely American English and  Latin American Spanish, and finally his exile from Chile where this book  ends.The chapters alternate between his early years and the Allende  years, before he brings it all together in the closing chapter.  The  writing is often in the present tense and meanders and grinds on and on,  thereby it is easy to lose a grasp of what's being said.  Nonetheless, I  quite liked the style, though much of the time I couldn't see what the fuss  of whether to use Spanish or English was about.  Well, so it's difficult to  be fluent and think and write in both languages.  This is a writer's  dilemma, his agony so to speak, but it's no big deal.  That is unless you  want to make it one, and Dorfman does.  Whatever, he seems to succeed in  his efforts to write in both languages.I feel he uses that theme here  as an overburdened vehicle to the Allende years and his involvement in the  revolution.  A guy like this is bound to be involved in some sort of  revolution or other.  And in this book his supposed squeaky clean honesty  reminds me of modern day politicians, who I do not trust.  I'd be watching  my back if Dorfman was around for sure, he protests too much and I feel  there is definitely something he is not saying although he is supposed to  be saying it all.I look forward to reading a novel by him though.\", 'overall': 3.0, 'summary': 'Mixed feelings', 'unixReviewTime': 937526400, 'reviewTime': '09 17, 1999'}\n"

I have read every single one of his books, bar none.  Bar none, this was poorest book he has ever written.  The settings, characters, and story line are classic -- you can pick almost everyone of them out of his previous WW II era novels.  It has a lot of plot similarities to Eye of the Needle and Jackdaws.However, the overall plot is extremely predictable.  You can see just what is going to happen after reading the first 25%.  The details however revolve time and time and time again on a  whole series of coincidences which is very out of character for Follett.  I liked most of his books because the story line follows a logical flow with interesting bobs and weaves stemming from an initial premise.  This was more like a low budget movie where things happen by coincidences and characters survive by inches or seconds so many times it becomes unbelievable and ridiculous.The climatic seen of the flight to England has to be the absolutely worst piece of writing ever by Follett.  The events are ridiculous, the characters repeatedly make stupid errors, and the whole thing plays like a cheap B movie.  For instance, are we to believe that the only character who knows how to fly the plane falls asleep during a night flight over water half an hour after almost being shot out of the sky -- and the inexperienced person that's awake lets her sleep?  Or the king of them all, are we to believe the character waits till the airplane is within minutes of running out of gas before remembering to add the extra can of gas he has in the cockpit -- which he could have done 4 hours earlier?  Or how about delaying a day the flight that will change the war and save thousands of lives so that the main character can go to the ballet?  Or how about the German guard helping push the plane out for takeoff because he can't put two and two together?  He must not be related to the other character that can throw a cigar into the cockpit of a small airplane at takeoff speed.Come on Mr. Follett, you can do better.

I wanted to read the words that a depraved sociopath would find interesting. This well read killer was documented to have also been seen reading Melville while imprisoned.  His hanging ended an era of killings, of maybe upwards of 200 people or more. He was well known to have dissected, and incinerate many of the victims, so the true number was never known.

There are paragraph- to page-sized entries on a wide variety of subjects, listed in alphabetical order.  If you\\'re looking for a good cover-to-cover read on Norse mythology, I highly recommend H. R. Ellis Davidson\\'s \"Gods and Myths of Northern Europe\".I own three of these dictionary-style books on Norse mythology, probably THE three such books: Lindow (this book), Rudolf Simek\\'s \"Dictionary of Northern Mythology\" and Andy Orchard\\'s \"Dictionary of Norse Myth & Legend\" (or whatever the current publisher\\'s calling it these days).Of the three, Lindow is by far the most accessible and user-friendly to the layperson.  There\\'s a wealth of information here, and it\\'s written and presented very well and with a healthy amount of humor (one doesn\\'t often see the poem \"Thrymskvida\" described as featuring \"Thor in drag\").That said, it\\'s also true that this book doesn\\'t contain the hoard of detailed, otherwise obscure information that Simek and Orchard have to offer.  On more than one occasion I went to look up something in Lindow and was surprised that it wasn\\'t there.  For example, I find it odd that there\\'s an entry for Ratatosk (a squirrel that inhabits the world tree Yggdrasil, a relatively minor character), but not one for, say, Svartalfaheim (in some accounts, one of the Nine Worlds of Norse mythology, realm of the \"black elfs\", or dwarfs).The bottom line is, if you have a casual interest in Norse mythology and want a well-written, simple reference, then Lindow\\'s your man.  If you want practically everything there is to know about Norse mythology that\\'s available in English, well, Simek or Orchard are probably your best bet.But even if you\\'re going whole hog and decide to get Simek or Orchard, get Lindow too, if for no other reason than that he\\'s an absolute blast to read.', 'overall': 4.0, 'summary': 'Excellent as a jumping-off point', 'unixReviewTime': 1185667200, 'reviewTime': '07 29, 2007'}\n",

In this book, we find out exactly how this happened.It is not a spoiler to say that Viscount Linford married his wife when she was just 16 and married only for her money (promised him by her miserly and misanthropic father), since this appears in the first chapter. We soon learn that he was a rather dissolute rake, but has changed his ways. Linford visits his aunt in London and is introduced to her entrancing friend, Mrs Emily Stowen, who is apparently a widow of means. However, it turns out that Mrs Stowen is neither a widow nor all that unknown to him. If you have read a few romances, you will guess her identity even before the hero does.The rest of the story is taken up with the attempts of Lord Linford to win back his wife through means fair and foul, and how Lady Linford finds her place as chatelaine of a great country estate, despite the machinations of a rather nasty neighbor. There is a sub-plot involving attempted rape and murder, and blackmail, although most of the story is focused around the growing friendship between Linford and his wife.My main problem with the story is that I found a couple of secondary characters - a young neighbor Lucy Maitland (and her family dynamics), and a retired Bow Street runner - far more interesting than the hero and heroine. When this happens, even a decent story loses its attraction. However, this might not happen to you.Anne Ashley writes a competent Regency romance, with nothing really jarring.

Hotchner, that revealed to the world upon its publication in 1966 that Ernest Hemingway died in 1961 not of an accident while cleaning a gun but of an intentional self-inflicted gunshot. If that was all this book had to offer the world on Hemingway, it would not still be in print.  He provides an up close and personal portrait of a man he admired and called a good friend, but a complicated personage all the same.  This is not a critical, exhaustively researched biography weighing 10 pounds; it is memoir by someone who experienced life with the man firsthand, an account that comes across with honesty and enough detail for readers to draw their own critical conclusions.Hotchner was a young writer dispatched by a magazine in 1948 to find the by then world famous Hemingway in Cuba and negotiate an article.  Hotchner's terror at the assignment turned into high surprise as Hemingway took to him and brought him right into his inner circle.  Hotchner never talks about himself really, so we don't know what Hemingway saw in him, but it had to be something because Hemingway was not a man who trusted easily, who required exacting standards in his pals, who also included restaurateur Toots Shor, Marlene Dietrich, Gary Cooper and Ava Gardner.  Hemingway was at the top of his powers in 1948, living as he thought life should be lived and settled in with his fourth and last wife, Mary, who could stand up to him.  On the pretense of editing work, he takes Hotchner along for European adventures, making fun while also disclosing memories of his earlier days, and most important, what inspired his classic novels.  As they move into the 1950's together, Hotchner also catches evidence of Hemingway's battle with mortality.  He has a tough road back to health after surviving a plane crash in Africa, and then, trying to work again, he is bowled over by the response to THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA (the Pulitzer) and the Nobel Prize. Castro, with whom he thought he had an understanding, takes his home and sanctuary.  He is briefly revived in the outdoors of Ketchum, Idaho, but depression and paranoia begin to tear at him.  What now seems a brutal electric shock treatment at the Mayo Clinic, especially for a man who never believed in analysis or being penned up, who wanted to do his own fighting, preceded his death.\", 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': 'Defeat not an option', 'unixReviewTime': 1188259200, 'reviewTime': '08 28, 2007'}\n",

The first-person narrative is such a bold move because it immediately gives a sense of autobiography that a lesser writer would have come across as merely self-indulgent. Yet, he invents an academic figure to \"write\" the foreword - Jakob Haarhuis, a fictional professor of Japanese at NYU, provides an explanation for how the memoirs are gathered, that they are the taped memoirs of the protagonist Sayuri.While it\\'s obvious that Golden has done his research, what takes the book to a higher level is the way he penetrates the psyche of the people caught within the orbit of this cloistered world. The story follows the life of Chiyo, a nine-year old Japanese girl who is sold into slavery along with her older sister Satsu. Because of her unusual grey eyes, Chiyo is then sold to an okiya (boardinghouse for geishas). The scenes in the okiya are Golden\\'s most meticulous and accomplished, especially as Chiyo undergoes a grueling apprenticeship and competes with the beautiful, worldly but wholly spiteful Hatsumomo, who is the okiya\\'s star geisha. Men become bewitched by her poise and subservient manner, and she takes her new name, Sayuri, symbolizing her metamorphosis into a professional geisha. Surviving some unsavory escapades with some of the okiya\\'s most undesirable patrons, Sayuri surpasses Hatsumomo in stature and becomes the mistress of the man she had set her heart on all along, the benevolent chairman of an electrical supply company.While a more predictable story would have stopped there with the love story, the author goes further and has Sayuri move to New York to run a salon for visiting Japanese businessmen until the chairman dies. In a certain way, I wish Golden did stop the book in Japan when WWII ends in the story. The chapters afterward feel rushed as if the author is losing interest in her story and wants the reader to get to the inevitable ending quickly. Regardless, Golden fills the book with vivid images and subtle descriptions of the nuances of Japanese culture. Absolutely invaluable in its detail if sometimes too overwhelming to appreciate at once (a repeated reading is recommended), the story reflects a brilliant eye for the customs and rituals within geisha society, including its politics, rivalries, and traditions. Having been to the historic Gion district of Kyoto, where present-day geishas still live, I have caught a glimpse of these women scurrying about in their beautiful kimonos looking both fetching and anachronistic. Golden captures their stories with compassion and an anthropologist\\'s fervor. This is strongly recommended both as fiction and an essential ingredient of Japan\\'s cultural history.', 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': \"Behind the White Mask Lie Further Layers of Subverted Identity in Golden's Sharply Observed Novel\", 'unixReviewTime': 1131753600, 'reviewTime': '11 12, 2005'}\n",

The characters again have that melodramatic quality that a noir atmosphere seems to need.

The side stories tell about life in the rural south as tobacco farmers, scraping to make ends meet by putting the entire family to work; life in the slums of Philadelphia plagued by child abuse, drugs, and violence; and the challenges for many poorly educated citizens to understand modern medicine, technology, and economics.In short, \"The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks\" is a compelling book about the interface of science and society, written for the general public but a wonderful \"read\" for both nonscientists and scientists alike.

Obviously hard to find unless one uses Protestant books. I purchased this book, but immediately felt disappointed. I am an at-home, homeschooling, very traditional Catholic woman, and some of the reflections rubbed me the wrong way, or were hard to relate to, because they were so contemporary and did not seem universal enough to apply to my life. They also struck me less as meditations and more as anecdotes. However, after awhile, the book began having an unexpected effect on me which, while different than I expected, was positive nonetheless. While I could not relate to some of the anecdotes or reflections, I did find myself learning more and more about how to apply scripture to my life, beyond the obvious ways the Church has always taught. It was as if, by relating the experiences and thoughts of other women, the book was giving me permission to insert my own story, my own sufferings and struggles and joys, into salvation history. So, while I do not find myself meditating on the given reflections in the way I expected, they DO inspire meditation! A second positive effect is, I find myself obsessively reading scripture out of curiosity as to what the next reflection will be! Three words of caution: First, while some reflections are only a page or two apart, occasionally there are many pages between daily reflections. In that case, one must make a choice of reading many pages, or skip large sections of the Bible to keep pace with the sequence of reflections. Second, there are a few reflections which are questionable in terms of theological accuracy. One example describes Christ\\'s birth as involving pain, blood, and an umbilical cord, which sounds to me like a denial of the Virgin Birth. Another cautions us against allowing our religious rituals to come between us and another person; this can be read in an acceptably orthodox way as advising us not to be too rigid, but could also be read as permission to skip Mass in the name of charity. Third, I am personally not fond of the inclusive-language translation of the NRSV. I realize it is approved by the Church, but sometimes in the awkward effort to use inclusive language, the meaning is diluted or completely altered. For example, sometimes the word \"man\" is used not simply to refer generically to any human being, but is meant to refer to Adam, either literally or figuratively. Therefore, changing it to \"person\" or \"humankind\" loses some of the intended meaning. As does the use of \"students\" in place of \"brothers\"; clearly those words are not synonymous. Thankfully, there are footnotes indicating the original words whenever these alterations are used. But these alterations seem unnecessary; I don\\'t know of any woman who has ever been offended by the original language of the Bible, which was, after all, authored by God. Overall, a worthwhile book. I would like to see a somewhat different version for women, perhaps drawing more heavily upon women saints than contemporary authors, and with reflections which are more truly meditative than anecdotal,using a non-incusive-language text.', 'overall': 4.0, 'summary': 'Grew To Like This Book', 'unixReviewTime': 1167350400, 'reviewTime': '12 29, 2006'}\n",

If you have ever listened to Governor Romney speak, this book reads like a long speech. It is readily comprehensible, plainly spoken, and frequently well versed.It is so named because Obama\\'s apology tours, denigrating America, are well known, and heinous for any American elected or appointed official to do, much less for the President of America. Obama should apologize for apologizing, and the best way for America to ensure he does that is to support great folks like Mitt Romney.Sometimes this book is not well versed.He addresses many problems facing America today. Overall he addresses them well, with some disagreements, some ignorance, some shortchanging, and some omissions.He names Russia, China, and Islamofascism as the three main foreign policy threats we face, plus he includes the somewhat minor actors such as Chavez in Venuesuela, Kim in North Korea, etc.His call for ensuring that Iran does not acquire nuclear weapons is stirring, but not stirring enough. His call for an anti-missile defense system is good, but not good enough. His warning of the threat of an Electro Magnetic Attack (EMP) on the US is brief; it is over in one mild paragraph. He does not really tie these three together as he should have. He does not really elaborate on what Iran and the rest of the world could/would do if Iran does become a nuclear power.He does not mention that we need a perfect anti-missile defense system to deter an EMP attack, for which we would only have 30 seconds warning from launch to detonation, and that is not enough time to react except automatically. Three missiles launched from three container ships off of our coasts could successfully send most of the USA back to the stone age with only 30 seconds warning, and Iran could mount such an attack.He does not cover, as Newt Gingrich does, as Mike Huckabee does, and the Heritage Foundation does, and as the Clarion Foundation does, how a successful EMP attack on the USA would be a civilization killer. He says we would be without electricity, but he doesn\\'t say that it would last for two or three years, and that over 90% of all Americans would die in the first year due to starvation, disease, and violence as civilization totally collapsed. I recommend \"One Second After\" by Newt Gingrich\\'s frequent co-author, William Forstchen, which, in novelization form as no attack has yet happened, is an accurate representation of the danger such an attack would be.Romney does not elaborate on how to keep Iran from accquiring nuclear weapons, what we shoud do besides toothless sanctions, or what to do if Iran does acquire nuclear weapons, which the Obama administration will allow Iran to do (i.e. will do nothing to deter or stop them).He covers all bases regarding Climate Change, coming down, sort of, on the side of adapting to climate change, rather than implementing a job killing tax increasing ponzi scheme like cap and trade. However, one has to question whether this is a subject the Governor really studied, for if he had, he would know that climate change is entirely natural; that CO2 is not the causative factor in climate change, and that man is not the cause either. As the East Anglia E-mails state, there has been 15 years of global cooling - is that also caused by CO2? It is a shame that the Governor really didn\\'t do his homework on this subject.Governor Romney has read \"America Alone\", by Mark Steyn, which covers the demographics that are going to turn most of the rest of the world\\'s countries into Islamist countries well before the end of this century. He has called it a powerful book, and has recommended that all members of his staff read it. The operative question is whether or whether not the USA can survive as the last Western Civilization country on this Earth.Governor Romney does not address how to keep the Chechen Muslims, like those who took over the Belsan school and slaughtered over 100 kids, from taking over Russia. What kind of threat will an Islamist Russia with all of their nuclear capablilities be? He doesn\\'t address the Threat from all of Western Europe becoming an Islamist continent, including nuclear armed France, overrun by the Muslim Brotherhood (who tried to blow up the twin towers in 1993), and what kind of threat that will be to America\\'s security. He doesn\\'t address the Threat of nuclear armed England, when the Deobondi sect of Islam (the Pakistan version of the Wahhabi sect that all 19 of the 9/11 killers adhered to) takes over England. He doesn\\'t address the threat of Islamist Canada being overrun by Wahhabism and becoming a springboard for invading the USA by these Islamists around the world. He doesn\\'t address the threat of large sections of Central and South America becoming Islamist countries. He doesn\\'t address the threat of Islam to the continued existence fo the USA as a non-Islamist country, and that becoming an Islamist country is a very, very bad event for our progeny. If we do lose this global war, as we are headed towards, and become an Islamist country, nothing, else, absolutely nothing else we are discussing today will matter.Governor Romney needs to spend some quality time with the U.S. House of Representatives Anti-Terrorism Caucus, chaired by Rep Sue Myrick (R-NC).As something needed to do to strengthen America, which he believes in firmly, fortunately, strengthening the traditional family, the real family, is a key part of his strategy and this book. His discussion of the actions needed is more thoruogh and detailed than even his economic analysis. This part of his book should be studied and his recommendations taken to heart by every American Politician of all political parties.Governor Romney has said on his book tour interview that this book is not about social values, and I accept his explanation.Overall, this is a worthwhile book, with many good recommendations. The flaws, and ignorance the Governor displays on some subjects, including the omissions, make this book deserving of a follow up book to properly address them.Governor Romney could have perfected this book without much more effort, and it\\'s a shame that he didn\\'t take the time to do it right in the first place.', 'overall': 3.0, 'summary': 'No apology is an apt title, but apologies are needed for omissions', 'unixReviewTime': 1268179200, 'reviewTime': '03 10, 2010'}\n",

With herself as a major suspect, Farrar, urged on by Enrico Caruso, initiates her own investigation, which turns out to be a delightful romp.Surrounding Farrar are stars who were a major part of her life during the Mets \"golden age.\" The author has created wonderful fictional sketches of Caruso, Pucinni, Emmy Destinn, Pasquale Amato, Toscanini, and actor David Belasco. Even Farrar\\'s young female fans, the famous \"gerryflappers,\" are given a part to play. The short Epilogue tells you what happened to these personalities in the following years.A more serious leitmotif is the constant references to the looming European war. Most of the singers are from lands increasingly drawn into the conflict. Memories of good times there are recalled amid the growing realization that that the war might last, that America may be drawn into it, and that the inevitable war relief tours will become standard fare. These tense moments are lighten by descriptions of the singers hangouts, the Met and Belasco theaters, Mulberry Street on the Italian immigrant Lower East Side, and, above all, the numerous backstage dramas.', 'overall': 3.0, 'summary': 'United States - New York, 1915', 'unixReviewTime': 1247616000, 'reviewTime': '07 15, 2009'}\n",

My sister loves books and being intrigued by beautiful cover art is how she chooses the books she is going to read, and it seems to work for her every time. I decided to try it this time with HALO.The summary on the inside sleeve of the book is decent enough to make you wanna read, and the first few chapters are quite easy to read through. There were times at the start of reading HALO that I was reading 5 chapters a day. I was impressed that Miss Adornetto was only 18-years-old when HALO was released. Her writing style was mature and descriptive. I was jealous at how easily writing seemed to come to her, when I\\'m older than her and struggle nearly every day to get my story ideas down on paper.However, getting past the angels settling in to their new environment, my opinion about HALO quickly went downhill. At first it was easy to look past Bethany\\'s naive in-take on everything, as this was her first time on earth and being human. But you\\'d think living in Heaven, watching humans live every day life from above would have given her a brain. I mean, you\\'d think instinctively she\\'d know right from wrong, but it was so easy for her to fall right into the role of being a teenager. Vanity and Xavier were the only things that mattered to her.There\\'s one part in HALO where Bethany attends her first teenaged house party, a party in which her beloved Xavier saves her from, and actually gets drunk off some alcohol because her brother Gabriel told her that humans have to keep hydrated.After the party Bethany starts to see Xavier more, sneaking out of the house one night to see him. It seems so easy for her to disobey her siblings and lose sight of their original reason for being on earth in the first place. She\\'s totally caught up in Xavier, thinking about him, talking about him, doing everything with him. It even gets to the point of not being able to exist without him. Xavier starts to annoy when he becomes overprotective of Bethany, insisting that she eat and drink regularly. As one reviewer said: he even plays airplane with her to get her to eat a power bar.Then, one day at school after talking to her girl friends, Bethany is influenced to bring up sex with Xavier, asking him if he\\'d ever thought about doing it with her and if he and his dead girlfriend Emily had a \"physical relationship\" too. This particular scene bothered me the most. Actually, Bethany brought up Emily a lot, wondering if she was as good as Emily.I found Bethany to be very weak and lacking a lot of faith. She often whined to Xavier, questioning his love for her and crying over the moment she\\'d have to return to Heaven, never to see or be with Xavier again. There\\'s one part that reminded me a lot of Bella from New Moon, just after Edward breaks up with her, where she\\'s depressed because she can\\'t live without her \"other half.\"Then there\\'s the new mysterious kid in school, Jake Thorne, who immediately gave me the impression he was bad news. Adornetto gave no mystery to this guy, describing him in dark clothing, long black hair and high cheek bones. Slowly but surely the goth students started to hang around him. There was no surprise when the rugby match came around and a dark figure stood across the field just before Xavier Woods took a fall and broke his leg and got a minor concussion. I knew right away it was Jake Thorne. Bethany acknowledged the figure but didn\\'t take much concern to it. You would think being an angel sent to earth to get rid of dark forces she could have sensed more from a dark force, which brings me to...Gabriel. When Jake attends the prom with Bethany due to the fact that Xavier had a concussion, he threatens her. Xavier says he can take Jake down but Gabriel insists that Jake is of dark forces, that no one knows exactly what he is or what he is capable of, that they need to find out first. He repeats this often, yet I never felt he put much effort into figuring out what exactly Jake was.Overall, I was disappointed in this book. I read it in a week and can\\'t believe I wasted my time. Luckily I only requested it free from the library. I wanted so badly to like this book, as the cover was amazing; I wanted to be able to have it on my book shelf. Apparently the picking-a-book-by-its-cover method doesn\\'t work for me as it does for my sister.HALO actually makes me feel angry every time I talk about it. The angels are weak; Bethany is too obsessive, too whine-y and too naive. Castiel from the TV show Supernatural isn\\'t as ridiculously stupid as these angels are. I do not recommend this book... unless you\\'re a huge fan of the Twilight saga and just want a story exactly the same, but instead of vampires and werewolves you get angels and demons.', 'overall': 1.0, 'summary': 'A beautiful cover with a fallen plotline', 'unixReviewTime': 1310083200, 'reviewTime': '07 8, 2011'}\n",

When I was about halfway finished, I ordered the hardcover copy, and the second book in the series -- it was just that good. I finally finished Kushiel\\'s Dart tonight, and felt inclined to write about it.This is not your typical fantasy. While there definitely are fantastic elements, there is no superhuman sorcery, no elves and goblins. Most of the fantasy in the book is reimagined history -- and that part is superbly done. It takes place in a Europe (Europa) of probably the 1000\\'s, with France (Terre d\\'Ange) being the most sophisticated country, more Renaissance-like than medieval. Much of the rest of the world, however, is delightfully primitive. Christianity is not dominate -- in fact, only a few Jew-like Christians are around in this world, although it is generally accepted by the French (D\\'Angelines) that there was a Jesus. England (Alba, which is definitely a well-researched name) is Pictish, and Germany is inhabited by barbarian Norsemen. The names for everything are perfect -- Hellas (Hellenism is the age of Alexander the Great) for Greece, Tiberium for Rome, Aragonia (think Ferdinand of Aragon) for Spain. It feels like she put a lot of thought into designing her world.The plot, too, is excellent. The main character is not your typical fantasy \"chick\" -- she doesn\\'t fight, magically or physically, and some things about her are almost repulsive. Pricked by Kushiel\\'s Dart, she feels pain as sexual pleasure -- and, thus, becomes very useful as a bed-partner to those with sadistic tastes. Still, I liked her quite a bit, and found her a very believable heroine. She saves her homeland -- through the use of her sexual skills, her beauty, and her wits.Plenty of people have criticized this book for being \"porn\". It really isn\\'t pornographic at all. There are vivid sex scenes, but they aren\\'t disgusting or pornographic. I wouldn\\'t recommend this book to a 12-year-old fantasy fan, but I wouldn\\'t warn anyone away from it due to the explicitness of the sex scenes.And the writing! The writing was just beautiful. Poetic, surpassing even the beauty of Tolkien. The heroine lives in a land of beauty and elegance, where every D\\'Angeline is descended from angels, and has their beauty. It follows that the language would be beautiful as well.An excellent book. Ten stars out of ten.

LTC B, my immediate boss did not know about it and I had to fill him in on what little I knew. LTC B quickly understood and did not ask anymore questions. About the time I was preparing to leave for the States 1LT Martin was wrapping up his operation with a lot of haste. I had no idea what had happened until I returned to the States and heard about it on the news. Little did I know how close I was to such a historical event.

I picked up the series after reading other reviews, and looking for another fantasy author that writes to a high caliber. He didn't disappoint.The Night Angel series provides you with a living world, dynamic characters, interesting action, and hideous villains. The lines of morality are skewed with shades of grey throughout as the characters delve their own flaws and find themselves lacking. Like any of us, they are faced with the reality of their situations and grow to overcome many (but not all) of their flaws.Weeks writes with a very visual style, giving your imagination plenty, but not too much, information to go on. Cities are painted to reflect their hidden nature, castle halls come to life through the action, and forests seem to have their own storyline. It can be hard to put the series down once you've picked it up.Why four stars then? A matter of personal taste. Weeks delves into some deep psychological areas of his characters, and doesn't shy away from some dark matters. Rape, Cannibalism, Torture are all included, and in some ways normalized. He's also liberally uses profanity. All of it fits within the world and characters he's created -- very little of it was jilted outside of the story. If those things don't bother you inside of a good story, then you'll deeply enjoy the Night Angel series. If you can overlook them in the context of the story, you'll find a deep world that will have you thinking about the characters after you've closed the cover. It left me wondering if Weeks could accomplish the same thing in the lines of Sanderson or Jordan without going into the nitty gritty of the darker side, and instead letting it merely exist with his characters.Nonetheless, a well written series, and with that caveat, worth the read!\", 'overall': 4.0, 'summary': 'Great series, but...', 'unixReviewTime': 1339286400, 'reviewTime': '06 10, 2012'}\n",

Now I personally have the balance and coordination of a drunken ostrich on a good day, so dancing isn't exactly my forte. But I love and respect the elegance of dance, both choreographed and improv. I admire the dedication people have to this sport; they constantly and consciously inflict damage and pain on their body to achieve that perfect move, that perfect moment. I found myself just as captivated by Sophie Flack's Bunheads as surely as if I were watching a live ballet.Watching dancers on stage or in a movie was one thing, but I wasn't sure about how I would enjoy reading about them. I often find that when a book revolves around a specific sport or hobby that isn't as well known, it can be somewhat offsetting to the reader. We don't understand the technical jargon that the writer casually tosses about, but I felt Flack handled herself wonderfully. If I didn't completely understand a move or maneuver, the rest of the description in the page was more times than not enough compensation. And while the novel does focus heavily on dance, it's so much more than that.Hannah struggles as a dancer translate easily to life. She's making decisions now as a young adult that will not only shape her career, but her life. After devoting her life to dance, Hannah starts to yearn for something more. While she still loves dance, she starts to realize she's missing the little things in life that we non-dancers take for granted regularly. When she meets Jacob she starts to really notice all those little things and that adds up into one big question: Can she have both ballet and a life of her own?With Flack's background as a dancer, this novel could have easily slid into the category of preachy and confusing. There is no doubt that Flack knows her stuff when it comes to ballet, but there's a fine line between knowing and writing. I must say that Flack danced that thin line with the finesse one would expect of a ballet dancer. This book is graceful, fast, and intoxicating to watch unfold.\", 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': 'The Irish Banana Review', 'unixReviewTime': 1324944000, 'reviewTime': '12 27, 2011'}\n",

Brown is a delightful read--one especially suited for those taking Web programming courses or wanting to learn the inside strategies on Web site design/programming preparation.The book starts off by covering the fundamentals of wireframes, personas, site maps, concept models, and flowcharts.  These components of the book are not only technical in a how-to format, but also practical in a business sense.  In fact, Dan Brown makes a point of stressing how to negotiate these \"deliverables\" in business meetings, in essence preparing the reader for a career in design strategies.The second part of the book not only emphasizes how to format the products (i.e., wireframes, personas, etc) into professional deliverables through providing structure for the reports, but also delves into competitive reviews, usability plans, and usability reports.  Of most interest to me was the competitive review, as it helped establish the framework (including site map) of a site I\\'m about to build.  One easily overlooked shortcoming of the book is that it doesn\\'t spend the time on research strategies, such as focus groups and interviews that the book A Project Guide To UX Design by Russ Unger does.  However, Communicating Design exceeds many other books in its elaboration on the personas, wireframes, site maps, flow carts, etc.--the actual deliverables.Although the book doesn\\'t delve into how to create the deliverables in different software programs (it only mentions a few of the usable programs like Illustrator and Microsoft Visio, for instance), one can go to Lynda.com for a month-to-month membership and access tutorials on these components.  Communicating Design shows, instead, how to create the different deliverables, how to conduct oneself in business presentations of the deliverables, and how to format them into impressive reports.It is also important to note that Dan Brown\\'s second edition felt more cumbersome at first, due to its wide size, but after spending time with the interior of the book, the read was quite pleasant.  The pages were glossed with lots of white space and friendly diagrams.Dan Brown\\'s book proved essential in helping me prepare for the initial design set-up of a Website, and I would argue that the steps he provides in his book are almost indispensable to making an excellent site.

It was a shock.  I assumed that everyone experienced music the same way.  Wrong!Do you ever ask anyone what happens when they hear music?  I didn't before I read this book.  Now I plan to ask everyone.Dr. Sacks has the kind of fine writing style and awareness of music that makes his tales seem as appealing as the cases that Dr. Sigmund Freud wrote about.  As Dr. Sacks pointed out, Dr. Freud didn't care for music so that gentleman failed to investigate and report on many of the phenomena in this book.We don't exactly know why the mind and body interact with music in the ways that they do.  Part is undoubtedly heredity.  Part is undoubtedly due to exposure to musical influences.  Some may relate to the language spoken in the home.  Difficulties with seeing may also be an influence.  Injuries to the body and brain can play a large role.  Dr. Sacks does a masterly job of using case after case to explore one aspect or another of these dimensions so that a complex picture emerges that's even more remarkable than the brain processes involved in reading.One of the biggest surprises in the book is that musical talent seems to be inhibited by some parts of the brain.  In similar way, music can also inhibit some other brain functions that we would like to get rid of.I had always wondered about those with perfect pitch, and the book explores that.  There are also wonderful sections on other seemingly inherited musical abilities.Dr. Sacks adds a lot of perspective to the history of music by making observations about various composers and the way that their compositions reflect certain musical abilities than others while explaining how the mental processes are different. Today, we can map the brain's activation in order to get clues about why certain behaviors are possible.  That final perspective adds a lot to the case histories.If you are like me, you'll find some of the cases to be heart-wrenching.  I was comforted a bit to realize that music made those sad lives better so there's reason to rejoice in that sense.So what was my big personal discovery?  When I listen to classical music of any kind, I can choreograph a ballet along with costumes, sets, and props to go along with the music that I see in color when I close my eyes . . . even if the music has never been used for ballet.

You can flip the book open to any page and pull out something worth reading aloud and for that alone, I'd take my hat off to the man.  But beneath the distracting beauty of the prose is a very familiar story.  A good man returned from a bad war in a small town with a dark side, in this case, Sicilian gangsters, including the worst of the worst, a one eyed knifeman.  Sound familiar?  It is.  Gatreaux is at his best when he's wrapped in descriptions of the little lumber town called Nimbus, but the characters who populate it are prone to portentuous talk and symbolic actions.  We have riffs on Greek myths, serpents in beds, man mountains engaged in knife fights in rivers, but I found little to persuade me from the thought that Gatreaux was bluffing with a weak hand.  Namely, that at the center of the novel, lie a pair of brothers that he doesn't seem to have a handle on.  The war veteran has apparently killed scores of men, so that he is accustomed to doling out death in close quarters, yet over 95% of men in World War One were killed through shelling or machine guns, both distant intervention.  It was this, the blindness of fate, that you couldn't see who you were killing, or who was killing you, that was responsible for much of the pressure described as shell shock.  Gatreaux's veteran comes across then as a mythic figure, but the author seems to want us to believe in the grit and truth of his town.  I found it ultimately impossible, when I couldn't believe in the grit and truth of his characters, leaving the book with a hollow beauty, disappointing despite the promise.\", 'overall': 3.0, 'summary': \"Writing can't disguise the weakness of the plot\", 'unixReviewTime': 1064880000, 'reviewTime': '09 30, 2003'}\n",

Ever human's IQ soars to 400 or something like that.This book suffers from the problem a lot of sci fi books have - the author isn't really able to conceive of what people that smart would think or do, or invent because - well - the author isn't that smart; so aside from characters being able to conceive of new differential equations on the fly (some people can already do that, I'd bet) and invent new languages there isn't much happening here.The funny part is everybody with a boring job (that is to say, everybody except the scientists) simply quit working so there is no food or anything to buy.

The action centers on Jim and Frank, young colonists on Mars, and Jim's 'pet', Willis.  Mars is run by the Company who supplies the colonists needs, including a boarding school for high school aged colonists and organizing the annual migration.  As Jim and Frank (and Willis) arrive at school they discover that not everyone working for the Company has the colonists best interests at heart.  The kind head master is replaced by an autocratic bully who promptly confiscates all guns and pets - including Willis.  While rescuing Willis the boys uncover a more serious plot and soon the three are fleeing across the planet to warn their families.This book is very much a precursor to STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND, the descriptions of the Martians, their culture, and abilities are very much the same.  The basic story is one of RAH's typical youngster(s) same their society with the help of friendly aliens, very much in the same vein as, PODKAYNE, HAVE SPACESUIT WILL TRAVEL, THE STAR BEAST etc.  As always with RAH's stories it is exciting, has more than a few interesting twists and will probably cause the reader to re-examine some long held beliefs.  It also has some more annoying RAH traits - the women are definitely there to feed the men and raise the children, the characters are all either completely good or completely bad.  RAH's familiar themes of 'arms make the citizen', 'big government is bad government', 'the aliens will save us' and 'women need to be protected by men' are also all there as well.This is a fun read, for both adults and children.

She didn't know about Bisland's attempt until they practically crossed paths in the Far East.This is a long book of nearly 400 pages but my interest in it never flagged.  One ad I saw compared Goodman's handling of the story to Erik Larson and I agree.  There are pictures of the people and places and modes of transport to help the reader feel part of the exciting trip.  Complications abounded for both women as weather, miscommunications, and mechanical problems with ships and steamers conspired to slow them down.One funny part of Nelly Bly's story is that she was suddenly approached by several young men, one at a time, who seemed eager to marry her.  Rumor had it that she was an heiress who was traveling to mend a broken heart.  Her sudden suitors were looking for someone wealthy to support them, and at least one didn't mind saying so.  Finally she told one young man that it was all an act; actually she was quite poor and a friend had paid for her trip.  That was the end of the suitors.I won't ruin the story by telling you who won the race but even afterward the story of the two women and the rest of their life is fascinating.  In retrospect, I suppose I could have predicted their fate, but then again maybe not.Highly recommended readingSource:  Amazon Vine\", 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': 'Women Attempt to Outdo Phileas Fogg in 1890s', 'unixReviewTime': 1359676800, 'reviewTime': '02 1, 2013'}\n",

You very rarely see that in romances, and I really appreciate it. There\\'s no reason not to have a blind hero in a romance novel. I loved Vincent as a character. He seemed real to me...he was a man who had accepted his disability with dignity, yet, was still at odd times overwhelmed by panic attacks in relation to it. His emotions ran the gamut, and I liked that. I also liked Sophia...to a point. She just seemed a bit too one-dimensional to me. Her only \"flaw,\" if you could call it that, was that she was not necessarily beautiful. But, the author seemed to solve that with new clothes and a hair cut. Besides her Aunt, Uncle and cousin, everyone else loved her, even if they initially thought she was unattractive on first meeting her, that opinion changed rapidly, and they ended up loving her. Even the \"evil\" cousin she had that ruined her self-esteem came off as an idiot that really didn\\'t dislike her. She never had a bad word to say about anyone....she was just a bit too \"goody-goody\" for me. I need to see that she\\'s got some flaw, or she just doesn\\'t seem real.The story overall was good, and I did like the way that Sophia came up with all of these ideas to help Vincent out on his estate. But, again, Sophia has all the ideas. Everyone else seems to be clueless. Another way that the Sophia character is too perfect. All that perfectness made for a bland story. There was really no conflict at all. There was some potential conflict that could have happened between Sophia and Martin, Vincent\\'s valet. But it just seemed like Martin disliked Sophia, then went away from the story for awhile, then came back and loved Sophia like everyone else did. So much for conflict. I really need some kind of \"spice\" to my stories. This one really had none.

But for the most part, I enjoyed it. Of course, this isn't a story about the first blush of love or the first stirrings of passion. Laren and Alex have been married for about five years. They were wonderfully in love when they exchanged their vows, but the crushing loss of a baby three years ago drove a wedge between them that they have not been able to overcome.The book opens with the MacKinloch clan under attack. Their homes are burned to the ground and Laren is injured. Despite her wounds, she doesn't turn to her husband. And it's his fear of her death coupled with the realization of her distance that wakes Alex up to the serious chasm between them. He vows to fix things, but watching the two of them try to reconcile is frustrating and sad. Alex is the chief of the tribe and he expects Laren to be the lady of his people. But she is terribly shy and her childhood as a poor outcast makes her feel unable and unworthy to be what her husband wants her to be. Instead, she finds her solace in glassmaking. It's a skill she learned from an old priest after her son's death. She finds beauty and purpose in her art and she has done it for years in secret.Laren's glass can generate the money they clan needs to rebuild. But Alex feels betrayed that she has kept this secret all these years. The two of them clearly love each other. However, it's difficult to watch them blunder through their relationship. Alex lords over Laren the same way he rules the clan. He tries to bend her to his will. Though admittedly, his intentions are good, he does real damage to her spirit and makes her feel that he doesn't value her for who she is. At the same time, Laren is guilty of being a martyr. She hides her feelings and keeps her secrets by telling herself Alex doesn't need to be burdened by them. I wanted to just shake them both, especially during the first half of the book.Things do get better, though, as our couple begins to understand and accept each other. And watching them finally come together is quite lovely. There is deep loss and sadness in their relationship, but there is real love there, which makes their journey worth watching... especially once they begin to communicate.An external threat does hover over our couple, in the form of the clan's enemy... who is trying to crush the MacKinlochs once and for all. Also, we've got some strong secondary characters, like Alex's brothers, which give the book more depth. I'm really interested to read poor Callum's story --and I hope it comes next.Overall, I found that I did enjoy this, especially once our couple started actually talking to each other. 4 stars.*ARC Provided by NetGalley\", 'overall': 4.0, 'summary': 'Finding love again', 'unixReviewTime': 1310860800, 'reviewTime': '07 17, 2011'}\n"

I was interested to learn about his relationships with other illustrators and artists, his personality and family, and his own view of the art world and his place in it.  Although I grew up with Rockwell\\'s covers on the Saturday Evening Post that were delivered to my family\\'s home every week, before reading this book I knew little about him as a person.Solomon\\'s a good writer and the book is a quick, easy read.  She focuses more on the events of Rockwell\\'s life than on his art, although the art is not neglected.  She seems to be writing more for the general reader than the art academic.What I found strange was Solomon\\'s references to Rockwell\\'s sexual issues, not that he really had any, that we are told of, but she gives us little off-hand remarks about homoerotic issues, and say . . . was there a latent pedophile lurking inside Norman?  I could not figure out her purpose.  Did she feel she needed to juice the book up a bit - in many ways Rockwell was sort of boring, not your drunken womanizer type male artist who\\'s relatively easy to write about - was she trying to establish her own creds with the gender studies and queer theory crowd, or is she subconsciously driven by repressed gender identity issues of her own?  Interpret at your own risk (phrase borrowed from Solomon herself - below).As a illustration (yes) of Solomon\\'s bizarreness, after planting the homoerotic, homosexual and pedophile issues in your mind, she comes (yes, intentional, read on) to write about a mural Rockwell did for the Nassau Inn in Princeton, N.J., which included an image of Yankee Doodle.  The first line of the Yankee Doodle song was to be written on the mural.  Was it \"Yankee Doodle came to town,\" or Yankee Doodle went to town.\"  The \"debate\" was written up in the July 17, 1937, issue of The New Yorker magazine.In Solomon\\'s telling: \"Princeton\\'s board of trustees took a vote; it resulted in a tie.  Rockwell settled on the word \\'came\\'.  Interpret at your own risk.\"  \"Come\" on, Debbie.  Not only that, if one goes back, as I did, and reads the entire original piece in The New Yorker, it\\'s clear the word \"came\" was chosen, but it is not clear that it was Rockwell\\'s choice.  Go figure.My recommendation: read the book but forgive Solomon\\'s overly fertile mind and ignore the obvious absurdities.', 'overall': 4.0, 'summary': 'A good book, but a very strange one', 'unixReviewTime': 1392249600, 'reviewTime': '02 13, 2014'}\n",

In essay after essay, I found myself saying,\"Go on, Joan. You said it, Joan. We are the same, you and I, Joan, etc.\" That is the type of book Slouching Towards Bethlehem is. Reading it, slowly, meticulously, I felt such a close kinship, a bond, not with the writer but with her words -- so carefully chosen and wonderfully articulated. These essays are not meant, honestly, for teenagers, although, if given a chance, the totality of the book would be most beneficial for their pliable and socially indoctrinated minds.The purport of this book is something that I can so easily identify with: the disappearance of the past for the establishment of a fragmented, roughly organized new society with newfangled, unaccustomed societal perceptions as well as an aggressive casting off of the traditional value system of those who were born and raised a long time before the emergence of the radical, cataclysmic sixties. These essays explore, through author Joan Didion\\'s own feelings and experiences and the feelings and experiences of those she encountered, the disharmononized emotions of the hippy generation vs the elders of the more reactionary periods, periods where: Free Love, Acid Trips, Groovy, Crystal Snorting Gurus and Muumuu Dressed Followers seemed a complex and social oddity in the hierarchy of those who were deemed, \"Not with it, man.\"What is so nice about these essays is that they are not condescending; there were and are thousands upon thousands of citizens and non-citizens alike who had and have no clue whatsoever as to what the counter-culture represented (me, honestly, being one in that vast catagory). Joan Didion thrust herself into its epicenter, and with a keen eye took it all in, trying to understand. The darkness of the counter-culture I think is best represented in the title essay \"Slouching Towards Bethlehen\" on page 101:  \"Pretty little 16-year-old chick comes to the Haight to see what it\\'s all about & gets picked up by a 17-year-old street dealer who spends all day shooting her full of speed again & again, then feeds her 3,000 mikes & raffles off her temporarily unemployed body for the biggest Hight Street gangbang since the night before last. The politics and ethics of ecstasy...\"  That was the darkness of the counter-culture, but that is not representative of the entirety of it. Didion\\'s family can be traced back all the way to the Donner-Reed tragedy in which cannibalism was the well known result. Thus, California is liked to that sole dark act; it is forever historically and symbolically linked, California becoming tarnished and not the land of \"Golden opportunity.\" That is one way of looking at the counter-culture. Or it can be viewed in this fashion, in the essay: \"Rock of Ages\" about Alcatraz Island on page 208:\"I saw the shower room (in Alcatraz) with the soap still in the dishes. I picked up a yellowed program from an Easter service...and I struck a few notes on an upright piano with the ivory all rotted from the keys and I tried to imagine the prison as it had been, with the big lights playing over the windows all night long and the guards patrolling the gun galleries and the silverware clattering into a bag as it was checked in after meals, tried dutifully to summon up some distaste, some night terror of the doors locking and the boat pulling away. But the fact of it was that I liked it out there, a ruin devoid of human vanities, clean of human illusion, and empty place reclaimed by the weather where a woman plays an organ to stop the wind\\'s whining and an old man plays ball with a dog named Duke...\"Maybe that is what the hippy generation was trying to flee from: \"Human vanities. Human illusions.\"Slouching Towards Bethlehem is a book where the search for meaning is in of itself the comprehension of change.

And despite some of the negative reviews here (which almost dissauded me), I found this book one of Satrapi\\'s most magical, perfect creations.  It\\'s quite different than the autobiographical, child-like Persepolis I, though readers of Persepolis II and Embroideries will recognize the general tone and style.  That said, it\\'s a work that takes you by surprise with its directness, honesty, and sheer invention.The book follows the last eight days of Nasser Ali Khan\\'s life, as he decides to resign himself to death after his wife, in an argument, destroys his precious \"tar\"--an Iranian sitar-like instrument.  He is a master musician, renowned throughout the country, and the great love affair of his life (despite one thwarted human one) was with this reciprocating instrument.  Unable to find another tar to requite his passion, he loses all taste for life and its joys, and decides to stay in bed until Azrael, the Angel of Death, comes for his soul.  While waiting, we get a series of flashbacks and flashforwards as he--and others--recount the stories and anecdotes that frame his life.  Reading this book is like listening in on family stories around the dinner table, which by their very nature are fragmentary, interrputed, and from multiple points of view.Though a simple story, the manner of telling it is amazingly complex and mesmerizing.  Satrapi\\'s storytelling is at its most concise here, but so much is revealed about the very human passions that shape a life, and how blind we are even to the people we live with.

I mocked this book when I was 14 for its obvious fabrications.How will it impact kids' decisions to know that they are being fed untruths, 'for their own good'?

I am certainly glad I did.  This author has an amazing gift.  I enjoyed the book so much I found myself resenting any intrusion that would keep me from reading.  I adored the characters, both Christian and Maddy.  Maddy is a Quaker and although some may be troubled by the thee-thou language, I found it a charming affect of the heroine.  Her faith was such a large part of her life, yet she married a Duke in part to save him from the horror of a madhouse as he recovers from a stroke.  The desperation this man feels at being trapped in his own body as he struggles is palatable and frightening.  You don't have a heart at all if you are not irresistibly drawn in to the story.  The abuses in the madhouse can be disturbing but nevertheless in context with the story, they serve a purpose.  If you like all hearts and flowers brain candy type romance novels, this is not the book for you.  Yet, if you want a riveting story, unforgettable characters, and an intense hero that will steal your heart immediately, and a heroine that you wish you could embrace, Flowers from the Storm is the book for you.  Christian, although reared with all the haughty arrogance of a Duke, learns a gut wrenching humility as he copes with his affliction and his dependence on his Maddygirl slowly turns into an intense all consuming passion.

      " review: David Broder wrote, \"our government has suffered from crippled leadership, from a slowdown of decision making, an impairment of its vital processes. The result has been an accumulation of unresolved problems and a buildup of public frustration so great that our quintessential American Characteristics- our optimism and self-confidence- have now been shaken. Millions of Americans now feel they have lost control of the government and that government has lost its capacity to act, to respond, to move on the challenges that confront our nation. In an era of rapid and accelerating scientific, technological, social and cultural charge, our governmental and political systems has been operating in superslow motion. Time has not stood still, but the processes of politics have\".This statement is a tough assessment of the state of our political system. What makes it more remarkable is that it was written forty years ago!Broder takes a look into the failing of the Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon presidency.This book is an interesting read and it rekindles how as our nation deals with our problems we have to take a long term view. It is curious that the one particular issue that does not stand out then that we have today is the deficit problems.  Even though this book lays the case for a less than stellar outlook of our nation's future, it also shows that even after 40 years after the words were written our nation keeps moving forward. \n",

      " review: When I first got this book, I did a quick scan through, and sadly thought this was a one star book.The book is completely random, with no apparent order or organization.  The jokes are what you would expect from a homophobic 8th grader.  And of the many dedications, one is to \"the letter q\".I was expecting a biography of his life so far, or an inside look at the UFC/MMA world from a fighters perspective.  Instead, I'll say it again, the book is just completely random.He tries to be funny with every line, and usually isn't.  It seems this book had zero editing, and everything was left in, just to get it to 170 pages.OK, so why the three stars?  Well, if you go through the whole book, you do get to know Forrest a whole lot better than you may have thought you knew him (Still not sure if this is a good or bad thing).Also, there are some solid tips for the amateur and wanna be pro fighter, that you just don't see anywhere else.  Stuff like what skin diseases you might get from sparring, and how to spot and treat them.  For anyone that trains, this really is a serious issue.There is also a little bit on how to cut weight, which you almost never find, probably 'cause it can be dangerous.  Which is why I was, one, happy to see it in here, and two, disappointed to not see a note on danger signs to look out for when cutting weight.  Just as importantly, he does a fairly good job on telling you how to rehydrate and bring your weight back up.He goes into many techniques as well, but in my humble opinion, books, and even videos on techniques, are usually best for reinforcing what you are doing in class (or giving you something new to try, but even then, it's usually best to have someone more experienced around to help you get it right).Also, there were no hidden gems in the descriptions.  Nothing that made me go, \"Oh, that's what I've been doing wrong\".The \"incorrect\" Greco: Double Underhook Body Lock did give me a good chuckle, as did the Kyokoshikin technique.  So not ALL the jokes were bad.On a side note, I've never been a fan of the famous \"Griffin vs. Bonnar\" fight.  To me, it was just two tough guys beating the crap out of each other with no technique or defense.Lately though, I've become a huge fan of both Forrest and fellow season one contestant, Kenny Florian, since both have become phenomenal fighters through incredibly hard work on their stand-up technique.Forrest was successfully winning his title defense against the physically superior fighter, Rashad Evans, until he got caught.Forrest is one of the many reasons that the Light Heavyweight division in the UFC is far and away, the most exciting division to watch. \n",

      " review: A terrific book that addresses many questions I had about the coming together of the Internet of things and the activities of the creatives among us. If you desire to build an innovative city, culture this is the book for you.  The book makes a compelling argument for opening up the silos of  equipment, machinery and expertise that our institutions are so protective of.  If you want to learn the basics of spot welding in an hour, why can't you. This brings to learning the minimum viable product idea from software design.  If you wanted to actually &#34;make ' something, where would you go now? This is more than software, this is real stuff.  Very readable, compelling and mind opening I recommend this book to parents, youth, educators, librarians, creatives, tinkerers, and just about anyone in this wealthy society of ours. Good for a four hour plane ride.  Hey if this is where Chris Anderson ( Makers, Long Tail)  wants to spend his time, why not you? \n",

      " review: A World of Wealth makes a strong argument for free trade as expected, but goes beyond that. It covers some economics 101 but not in a condescending way but as a way of basing his arguments in the foundations of economic theory. As an example, his explanation of the power of free markets and the invisible hand that balances markets is very enjoyable and easy to understand as is his depiction of trade restrictions and subsidies artificially affecting markets making them inefficient.The book then talks about oil, global warming, taxes, immigration and many other related topics. It would be almost impossible to talk this broadly about economics without making some kind of a political statement, but this book implied the author's political position by defending the core values he believes in.I think the author is spot-on on many of his arguments like looking at immigration as a form of free trade. Simple concept, yes, but if people understood it we would be having a very different conversation about immigration worldwide - governments that advocate free trade could not responsibly support a protectionist immigration policy, for example. It points out other nonsense practices like welcoming students to Harvard, equipping them with the best education available worldwide, and then sending them home because they are not good enough to work in this country.Thomas Donlan is no Milton Friedman - the book does not offer groundbreaking theories or advanced economics. Still, this is a book I would recommend to anyone as a book about common sense meets economics explained in terms anyone can understand yet deep enough to be valuable to serve as a statement that could impact the way you see the world and current events. \n",

      " review: Arthur Miller created a timeless classic when he wrote The Crucible. A play composed of themes describing the courage and integrity of those who were trying to remain upright, authorities gaining too much control, hypocrisy overtaking a people, guilt for past sins, revenge that was fueled over generations, and mass hysteria that gripped the Puritan village of Salem in 1692. In addition, being published in 1953, this book reflects the McCarthy era and the Red Scare hysteria that was created from an idea that had no significant evidence. Although this play is set in a time of long ago, the overriding themes and lessons that can be taken from this novel are still relevant for people today.The small Puritan village of Salem is obsessed with the idea that there are witches residing among them. Since they are resolute about living a life lead by the Bible which states \"Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live\" (Exodus 22:18), they are overcome with fear that witches will corrupt them. Once the young, promiscuous Abigail Williams begins condemning common people from the town for witchcraft, mass hysteria is created and more and more people are accused of this fatal sin. People are thought to be witches until proven otherwise, and even some of the town's most highly-praised citizens are condemned. John Proctor who once had an affair with Abigail, is condemned of being a witch himself and deals with conflicts within himself of guilt, fear, and even courage as he struggles against what he believes is right and what others are telling him is right. The Crucible provides countless thoughts that provoke the reader to think about society, their beliefs, and examine their own inner selves.How do people react to crucible situations today? This novel has many connections with the McCarthy Red Scare that completely ruined the trust and reputations of many innocent people in our government and society. It is a play which is easy to understand yet possesses many thought-provoking and deep ideas about how one person can make such a huge impact on so many people's lives as did Abigail Williams. Even when characters in The Crucible knew that what was occurring was wrong, they were either too late to protest or did not have enough courage to stand up for what they believed. The Crucible will benefit anyone who reads it, and encompasses many topics relevant to people today. \n",

Many books need to be read over and over, returning to them is like going back to visit an old friend.But there are some, that the first time is always the best, and you are ever envious of those who are reading it for the first time.Winterdance is such a book. In the book he often describes the feeling of wonder and exitement for what is around the next bend. Each page feels like this. You relish each page, for the dry wit and frank way Mr. Paulsen deals with his adventures, but you can hardly wait for the next page.Mr. Paulsen is rank about what he did wrong, and does not try and attribute his successes to anything more then luck. He laughs at himself easily and invites the reader to laugh with him.A wonderfully well written book, that takes off at a dead run, and never stops. \n",

I go to it every time I have questions about terms, herbs, how to prepare specific items, the proper season to look for certain foods... etc.  Not to mention the recipes, wow.  You will impress family, friends and guests with the beautiful presentation and tastes and yet the recipes are easy to follow and explain things a novice cook (such as myself) would need to know.  I am still learning from this cookbook and enjoying preparing and presenting these dishes.  If this were the 1960's you would buy a Julia Child cookbook.  Now, it should be this one. After years of cooking and many cook books this is still my go-to for information and a meal that is truly artful.  And even if you are not lucky enough to live in the Pacific Northwest Susan Bradley coaches you through substituting fresh local food from your area.  In a time of high gas prices and questionable products from far away places, cooking with local seasonal foods not only makes good sense but makes you a better chef.  After several \"dud\" cookbooks lately I was hoping to find another one by this author... maybe one's in the works? Anyway, this is a must to own. \n",

      " review: Mo and Meggie's world has been turned inside out. Newer characters such as Farid, Darius, Orpheus, Resa, etc. are brought even more to life as Meggie's own life continues to change at an intense pace. Her mother, Resa, has been retrieved from \"Inkheart\" but it's not the last time any of them see this Inkworld. In Inkheart, Mo and Meggie succeeded in extricating themselves and their loved ones from the Inkworld to a peaceful life in the real world. In Inkspell, they are plunged yet again into the dangerous and decadent medieval fairy-tale setting (as in Inkheart, a mix of Tudor, Venetian, Florentine, Renaissance, etc.) and this time they become truly immersed as characters in its story...If you felt intense emotions for or against any of the characters in Inkheart, you'll feel them all over again in Inkspell too. My hatred for Mortola, Basta, etc. increased even more, if that was even possible considering how much I hated them in Inkheart; they are self-serving, murderous sociopaths, quite like Capricorn. We meet more of these sociopaths along the way (there are plenty of them in this book and in Inkdeath, the final book in the trilogy) who make life a living hell for Mo, Resa, Meggie, Dustfinger, etc. and any innocent citizen of Lombrica.As a witness, I was irritated at Meggie for some of her actions and attitudes, but as a reader, I thanked her because her actions set the foundations for Inkspell; in a similar vein - but instead of annoyance and exasperation - I felt burning hatred for the unctuous, smug, merciless despot of a storyteller, Orpheus, who has such an unwarranted sense of entitlement that you want to smack his turgid and doughy face until he surrenders and leaves. Cornelia Funke has spun such drama with her words that you feel some kind of emotion for ALL the characters...and what you feel isn't one-dimensional; your feelings become more complex, as in the case of my feelings about Meggie (among others).It is an exciting story with a healthy dose of danger, diabolical villains, hope and goodness; it's a wonderful balance of light and dark and just as Inkheart provided us with intensely dark and light atmospheres, Inkspell does a very good job of following up with that with another substantial dose without compromising the integrity of the story. This is definitely a worthy sequel to Inkheart. \n",

      " review: A lot has been said about this trilogy, a collection of these stories: The Golden Compass, The Subtle Knife, and The Amber Spyglass.It's all true.  The adventures.  The religion-bashing.  Parallel universes.  The stimulation of the imagination.You will find yourself pausing, and just thinking about the story you've just read.This particular volume is an economical collection of the entire tale.  It's a thick book for carrying around (almost 1000 pages), and the soft-bound edition probably will not take a lot of abuse in backpacks. Nevertheless, it will be a classic in the young adult fantasy genre.At one time, Lyra and Will are in a conversation with a scientist, Mary, who finds a way to communicate with Shadows.  Will asks her if she believed the Shadows really were angels, as they claimed.\"'Ah, but I knew about them.  I used to be a nun, you see.  I thought physics could be done to the glory of God, till I saw that there wasn't any God at all and that physics was more interesting anyway.  The Christian religion is a very powerful and convincing mistake, that's all'\" (p. 871).And will this book make atheists of all the children who read it?  It hasn't so far. \n",

So I started &quot;In Mortal Combat&quot; and found it so compelling I read it even while brushing my  teeth.As a John Toland fan, I was especially interested in  &quot;Captured by History,&quot; because he tells how he wrote the other  books--how he found the close friends of Adolph Hitler, how he persuaded  the key Japanese to tell, for the first time, the roles they played in  World War Two.John Toland's book is valuable for writers, because it  contains lessons in interviewing and organizing.It is an inspiration for  anyone struggling to achieve a goal.  Do you ever feel like a failure?  Well, Toland, one of the greatest historic writers of this century, was a  &quot;failure&quot; most of his life.  It wasn't until his late 40's that  he achieved success as a writer.  Toshiko, his wife, reminded him that his  years of failure were merely stepping stones toward later success.John  Toland spent a life-time interviewing historic figures of the 20th century.  Yet as &quot;Captured by History&quot; reveals, the unobtrusive Toland is,  himself, a figure of history. \n",

      " review: Peter Robb's \"A Death in Brazil\" defies classification. The narrative flows easily back and forth between the author's personal experiences and the greater context of Brazil's history. Those looking for travel and culture will find exquisite descriptions of food, architecture, and the sensuality for which Brazil is known. Historians will enjoy his digressions into the little-known world of Brazil's dry northeastern highlands, populated by bandits, the landless poor, and the descendants of an escaped slave community that once numbered almost 30,000. Finally, if the book can be said to focus on any one story, it is that of a provincial political family's descent into scandal after the accession to the presidency of Fernando Collor in 1989. Robb deftly weaves together the threads of this tale, building it gradually from an election-finance fraud into a dramatic conclusion worthy of Shakesperean tragedy - or a modern-day telenovela.That said, while the reader can happily get lost in Robb's descriptions of Brazilian life, those looking for a simple plot and a satisfying conclusion will be disappointed. At times, anecdotes are thrown in with hardly any context and then forgotten, and at times the political scandals involve so many characters that I considered taking notes. Academics will also be disappointed by the absence of sufficient citations for the multitude of quotes used by the author, which appear in inexplicable and confusing italics instead of within quotation marks. While the story of the Collor family and their associates is more or less ended, many other tales - including the author's own brush with death which opens the book - are left frustratingly behind. Then again, the subtitle is \"A Book of Omissions.\"All in all, highly recommended. \n",

You will be completely steeped the history of the Kings and Queens of England, and the buildings they had built and lived and died in. You will hear stories that you probably didn't know. Mr. Berry uses the history as the main turning point for his plot. This is the only problem that I had with this book. The King's Deception all hangs on Queen Elizabeth I. Mr. Berry proposes that 500 years of laws and property deeds will be destroyed if the truth comes out. So that must be prevented. It just doesn't seem that realistic to me. Maybe I'm wrong, just my opinion.The action and storyline were good. There was a bit too much of the serial novel feel for my tastes, but if you like this series, then you will like this volume.I give this book 3 and 1/2 stars out of 5.

Took me a day to read it and I agree with the previous reviewers.What I didnt quite like:1. Not enough time was spent on Tracker and Ari's relationship.2. Not as steamy as Caine, Sam and Tucker's stories.3. Did anyone find some parts difficult to comprehend?4. Author made a mistake while Tracker was in thought and refered to Ari as having a 'niece' implying Desi had a girl but she had a boy.What I liked:1. Tracker like the other guys, had a nickname for Ari.2. There was some humor and more flirting and less 'sexual' scenarios. (i know good and bad.)3. Zach!I would like to see Shadow and Zach's story as well. Afterall, Tracker refered to him as \"Hell's eight\", they all seem to be adding new peeps to their land. Zach and Maddie(or was it maggie?) maybe? I wonder how long we have to wait for the next one.

I loved all the characters, and I can see why the author intentionally did not want to write sequels, and accomplished the task by being sure that every character in the book who was eligible (not to mention 'straight') for marriage got married in this book.  The result: 3 marriages at Gretna Green.  This may not appeal to some readers, but it was so well done and a perfect ending to the book.  Usually, I tend to find at least 3 or 4 favorite characters in a book, but in this one, I liked nearly all of them equally.  I do wish we had seen just a bit more of Captain Hardy, but I wasn't unhappy with the way he was written in for Maggie.  I loved how everyone got married off, especially the nieces.This book had humor on nearly every page.  It was not what I would call rib-breaking funny, although there were occassional laugh-out-loud moments throught the book.  Mostly, I sat reading it with a grin/smirk on my face and chuckles throught.  I am not sure who to compare the humor to, possibly Sabrina Jeffries?  I'm not really sure.As far as the 'playing' goes, they didn't till the last 100 pages of the book, and then, only twice.  If you want a spicy read, you do not want this book.  It was more about friendship & love than about the physical aspects.  In fact, I would put the physical aspects on par with the Suzanne Enoch books I've read.  In other words, pretty basic stuff, no graphic details.  You won't find this to be like a Nicole Jordan book.Now, the matter other reviewers were complaining about, the use of modern day language between the young ladies in the book.  I did see a couple of short, blink & you'll miss them, lines on this order.  I do agree that \"Oh, Great!\" and \"As if!!!\" don't belong in historical romance, but I do not let this stop me from giving the book a rating of 10 on the 1-10 rating scale.Will most definitely look forward to reading more of Elizabeth Boyle's works in the future. \n",

The description made it sound so much better than it turned out to be.First of all, it started out so slowly that I found myself wishing I was finished with each page, randomly flipping forward at times. Then I noticed the common writing errors - the biggest one that caught my attention was the poorly written dialogue with absolutely no proper dialogue punctuation. So that became a poke in the eye that I just couln't ignore. Then, sporatically throughout the book, Majors throws in pages of screen play writing.I'm pretty sure Majors was experimenting a bit when he violated common rules of writing, but it didn't come off well and ultimately ruined the story experience entirely for me.UPDATE: I'm continuously amazed at how Amazon customers continuously give negative feedback on reviews that are less than stellar. No this book did not deserve any higher rating, and yes, I was honest about my impression of the book. Why this received so many negative feedback ratings is amazing.

      " review: Heretics takes place 1500 years after the death of Leto the Tyrant and some five thousand years after the original Dune novel.  Human domains face a new challange, that of the return of \"The Scattering\" that left in the wake of the famine that followed Leto the Second's death.  There is a powerful new group that has entered the scene, a group of women known as the Honored Matres who can control men with their newly discovered techniques of sexual prowess.Due to the superior numbers of the Honored Matres and their new sexual techniques, the Bene Gesserit are on their heels.  However, they have both a new Duncan Idaho ghola and have found a girl who can communicate with the \"Divided God\" on Rakis (the current name for Dune.)The Bene Gesserit devise a plan for their own survival, and it includes both the Idaho ghola and this Rakian girl.  They will need to use all of their abilities and manipulate old rivals such as the Bene Tleilax to maintain their status.This novel bounces around more than the others.  The majority of the action occurs off of Rakis, though Rakis is vital in the plot of this fifth volume of this epic.  With the extablishment fighting for its very survival against this new onslaught, a combination of creativity and desparation is both needed and evident.Herbert has done a supurb job of keeping this story moving through the millenia as the characters keep changing, but the major \"geopolitical\" players remain the same (with the exception of the major new addition of the Honored Matres.) \n",

      " review: I just purchased 7 of these books to go into gift baskets for my bridesmaids because the cover matches exactly the colors for my wedding and all my girlfriends are romance readers, too. I bought an extra one for me, because I LOVE romances and I'm always hoping to find a new writer that is really good. There was never a point where I skipped ahead because I was bored, and I find myself doing that alot lately in the romances I have been reading. I couldn't put it down, and I have been super busy these days. My boss even caught me reading it at work! I really liked Rebecca and Connor, I cared about what happened to them, but Edelston was actually my favorite character. He was alot more complex than your typical bad guy. I also loved the gypsies because I learned stuff about them that I never knew. I'm not a professional reviewer, but I am a romance-aholic, so I have read my share of good ones and bad ones. The Runaway Duke really stands out among those I have read. I won't be turning it into the used book store any time soon!

      " review: 4.5 stars\"Darkness Devours\" by Keri Arthur is the third title in her `Dark Angels' series and features Risa, a hybrid of an Aedh and a werewolf mother who was horribly murdered.  Risa has an ability to walk in the gray fields and talk to souls and unlike most individuals, she is able to see reapers.  Her involvement in the loss of one of the keys that can unlock the portals of heaven and hell leaves her vulnerable to blackmail and/or a death sentence by the Directorate of Other Races.  Her complicated love life encompasses the werewolf reporter Jak Talbot who betrayed her in his pursuit of a story about Risa's mother as well as the mysterious Aedh Lucian who thinks their incandescent sexual relationship entitles him to plunder her mind at will.  There is also the issue of her bodyguard Azriel who is a reaper/shape-shifter and their tangled relationship which has intensified during their struggle to find the keys.  An assignment by the Directorate threatens Risa's life as she attempts to discover the perpetrator of a series of horrific crimes even as the threat of the missing keys and the dangers posed by the Ania demons who seek to capture her cause additional complications.  The more she discovers, the less likely she is to survive long enough to accomplish any of her goals!An intricate and thrilling urban fantasy filled with sensuality, violence and imagination.  Risa is a contradictory mixture of tenacious and competent warrior combined with conflicted and vulnerable lover.  There are so many factions and different agendas entertwined in this tale that it would probably be helpful to read the first two novels in the series (\"Darkness Unbound\" and \"Darkness Rising\") first but this tale is mesmerizing in its own right.  The steamy interludes interspersed with the sometimes horrific occurrences that she is involved in reflect the contradictory state of Risa's life, including the chaos engendered by her attraction to such disparate lovers and make this an intriguing yet sometimes uncomfortable read.  Be forewarned, there is no final resolution by the last page but one will definitely be curious to see how the story continues to play out and impatient to read the next volume in the series.

      " review: The cover of MISSILE MOUSE: THE STAR CRUSHER may lead you to think this is a cute mouse comic just for kids. It's not. While it's certainly a book aimed at young readers, it's also a sci-fi action/adventure story with deep themes and complicated plotlines. It's not your average, run-of-the-mill cutesy kids book with bad jokes and visual puns.In fact, jokes and puns are few and far between (oh, they're there, but they're not the focus). The focus instead is on the heart of the story, which involves the titular hero's quest to live up to his father's dreams and aspirations for him (\"You are a mouse who matters. Don't ever forget that.\") while protecting the universe. In that regard, Missile Mouse is a secret agent for the Galactic Security Agency who, after failing to protect an important star map from falling into the wrong hands, is rebuked by his boss, saddled with a partner, and charged with stopping RIP (the Rogue Imperium of Planets, natch) from unleashing the Star Crusher, which will destroy the universe. RIP has kidnapped the one scientist who knows of this 1,000-year-old device and how to implement it.Creator Jake Parker is an animator, so his book-length story has the visual appeal of a long animated special, as well as the look of one. It's quite nice. It gives the story a flow and an orientation that are easy to follow and engaging to read.The story is dark at times (one scene in particular, in which a group of bad guys are capitally and gruesomely punished by the lead villain, is perhaps a little too much for the very youngest readers), but it's well-suited for the suggested age range of 8-12, as well as for older kids and even adults interested in the book. Nothing in the story is childish, and it in fact has a broad appeal, and the action is fast and furious enough to hold most readers rapt while enjoying it. \n",

      " review: I found book 1, The Earth Painter, and instantly downloaded it and began reading. I wasn't sure what to expect at first. As the story unfolded I thought it was going to be the author's interpretation of how God (the Sculptor) created the planet Earth using his disciples; the Painters - Earth, Water and Space along with the Sciences - Bio, Geo and Chem.Now, I don't want to lose you here, and make you think 'Oh boy. This book just dipped it's pages on the side of science-fiction with a twist of theology.' By no means is that the case. This is a story of finding a long lost love you weren't sure even existed and at the same time, discovering yourself.Theo's and Holly's paths converge in the high school auditorium. Holly arrives in a new school, in a class she didn't sign up for. Theo is sitting on the edge of the stage watching. Holly takes notice of Theo and from that moment on their lives change. Theo can't figure out what he did for Holly to notice him and Holly doesn't understand why no one else ever noticed Theo.This two-book series will warm your heart, make you chuckle, irritate you a bit, make you smile and maybe cry, but most of all, it will open your mind to a new idea. It will make you think about creation. Even if that wasn't the author's intent. It will broaden your senses and leave you wondering.I thoroughly enjoyed both books in the Painter Series. And though the second book warns that the story clearly reads from a more adult point of view, it is very much still good for young adults and older teens to read. There is no gratuitous sex or graphic word-play at all to classify this book for 'mature audiences'. \n",

      " review: What a wonderful first-published book from author Carey Wallace.  The story of a young woman going blind and how she copes with being blind sounds like a depressing story but not in the hands of this gifted writer.  We are treated to so many beautifully written descriptions of the blind contessa's world and a bittersweet love story that the reader is caught up in the character's lives:  you can \"see\" what they see.  The main characters are very likable, even with their faults.  Wallace doesn't make the mistake of overdoing the descriptions and story so that they sound like schlocky poetry or melodrama.The blind contessa learns to see by dreaming and these vivid dreams are wonderful: flying through the night sky, discovering new oceans, going to parties and walking through forests.  Her imagination goes on and on.  Reading this book lets your own imagination soar.  I didn't want the book to end.My only quibble is that the characters could have been fleshed out a bit more.  Liza, the contessa's maid, is a complicated and dark character but we really find out nothing about her past.  I guess we can use our own imaginations!If you like books written by Alice Hoffman, you might like this book.  It has the same wonderful magic that her books do; the writing transports you to another time and place. \n",

      " review: The descriptions of the passive agressive male and his behaviors were dead-on, but the explanation of their motivations was unhelpful &amp; didn't seem plausible in many situations that I have personally experienced.  Then, instead of saying &quot;Here is how to get a passive agressive man to communicate/do what he said he was going to do/behave appropriately,&quot; Wetzler turned around and said that it is all the fault of the women who choose PA men as partners, employees, coworkers, or whatever; that there are 3 basic flawed female personality types who are drawn to PA's. So he blames women for enabling and perpetuating passive agressive male behavior. One of his examples of a typical passive agressive male &amp; his female enabler was of the man who says he will do dishes and fails to do so for several nights in a row. We all know the end of this story: the woman eventually gets tired of reminding the man about his promise and disgusted with the mess so she does the dishes herself. Wetzler gives no suggestions as to how to resolve this in a way which curbs the passive agressive relationship cycle. (hire a housekeeper? nag the man incessantly until you are sick of hearing your own voice? serve him with divorce papers? ignore the dishes until the vermin chase you out of your home? WHAT?) His final conclusion is that there's nothing a normal person can do to circumvent passive agressive nastiness, that PA men must go to a qualified therapist. Well, gee, thanks Scott. Did ya get that, people? Save the money you would spend on this book &amp; send your passive agressive man to therapy instead! \n",

According to the inside of the book the original was published in 1954 in a magazine, with an expanded edition following in 1955. This revised edition was published in 1978 (presumably to accompany the release of the 2nd movie version).  I do wonder how much was really changed though.  Aside from dates, references to 70's model cars and jogging, not much is there to distinguish from the 1950's.I've loved this story since seeing the 1956 film version as a kid.  If you've seen that movie you'll find the feel of this book much the same.  The only major differences come towards the end where we are given much more insight into the aliens and their motives, and a finish that is different from any of the theatrical versions.Easily a five star story aided much by Finney's conversational prose.  If you liked any of the movie versions it's worth reading the book. \n",

      " review: More of a novelette than a novel (a mere 224 pages), The Flawless Skin of Ugly People is an interesting book. The publish touts it as a love story between two flawed people, saying, \"Thanks to Ugly Betty, America is finally ready to read a love story about a couple who isn't sleek, slick, tucked, pulled, or plastic.\"In one sense, this is true. Both of the main characters -- and the majority of the supporting ones -- are deeply flawed, thoroughly imperfect, and not very pretty. The publisher's description, however, suggests that The Flawless Skin of Ugly People will be a story in which skin-deep beauty (or lack thereof) isn't an issue.The Flawless Skin of Ugly People is entirely about the surface. Getting fat, getting thin, popping zits. It's emphasized repeatedly that these imperfections do not make the characters unlovable (sometimes these flaws are even wholly loved in and of themselves), but it's always present that these flaws are just that: flaws. All the characters have other issues as well, and it's clear that simply getting clearer skin or losing half their weight won't solve all their problems, but the readers also know that it sure couldn't hurt.By the end of the book, everyone's accepted themselves and is working on getting pretty. The message is clear: fixing the inside will let you fix the outside and then you can be perfect through and through.This stands in stark contrast to the 'Ugly Betty' motto: love yourself. Love your fat, love your zits, love your big bushy eyebrows. They're not flaws, they're just WHO YOU ARE.The Flawless Skin of Ugly People wasn't a terrible story, actually. It was engaging and moved quickly. However, the publisher's description (which is the one on the back of the book) is thoroughly misleading. If you're looking for a book about imperfect people in an imperfect world learning to love themselves, you're better off passing this one by. \n",

Whoever was guiding the camera and setting shots was lackluster and just \"got the job done.\" Kubrick, besides being a misogynistic f* with an adolescent appetite for his films' contents, really delivered nothing...and he took his time doing it.This movie isn't bad because it wasn't sexy enough (I think it was sexy without need), nor because it was slow (I love slow, ponderous films), nor because there was no climax (same), it was because it was poorly directed and poorly written. The dialog is so often laughable. I was advised to see it as one of the creepiest films of all time. I never blinked. I felt like laughing at the attempts at creepiness though.For people who want to point at the themes explored, it doesn't matter if a film brings themes up, it matters how it handles them. This did a poor, surface level job just in order that Kubrick could get his kicks out of using the F word and having nudity that isn't necessarily sexualized...oooo, how progressive!I wasted my evening, don't waste yours. \n",

There is nothing more disheartening than to be pulled out of the story by something so easily fixed.  And I had the revised edition!  That being said, the story is interesting, and I was inclined to read it despite the mistakes.  Some of it is a bit fantastical, and some of the characters are more sterotypes than believable as real people.  Some of the discoveries were more of an &#34;oh, come on!&#34; instead of scary or intriguing.  And the name of the town, &#34;Spooky&#34;?  Really?  If you can get past some of these rather sophmoric things, there is a nice little story. \n",

      " review: If you're looking for a brief overview of the Scotch-Irish and their role in American history, here's an interesting place to start. The Irish Scots and the \"Scotch-Irish\" takes its name from an article the author wrote for The Granite Monthly of Concord, New Hampshire, to which were appended several other pieces--all of which were first published in book form by the American-Irish Historical Society in 1902. Unlike most accounts of the Scottish families who re-settled in Ulster beginning in 1612-1620 and continuing through most of that century, Linehan's essays focus less upon the animosities between the Scotch-Irish Presbyterians and Irish Catholics and more on their cultural commonalities. Drawing on studies of language, religion, and history, the author contends that, in terms of ethnology, literature, and tradition, the Scotch-Irish had more in common with their Irish heritage (in Scotland as well as Ireland) than was customarily believed. Among other things, this was reflected in the names they chose for their settlements and fraternal organizations in America. The author expands upon this theme in discussions of medieval Scottish and Irish history, which reveal that many of the Scots who migrated to Ireland in the 17th century were in fact descendants of Irish families who relocated to Argyle in 503. Linehan also discusses the founding of a number of Scotch-Irish communities, such as Antrim, New Hampshire; Ulster Irish participation in the colonial wars and the War for Independence; and countless instances of Irishmen as \"builders of the New Nation.\" Genealogists will appreciate the list of the original Scottish settlers of the Ulster Plantation, 1612-1620, and the detailed name and subject index containing over 1,000 references. \n",

      " review: This was honestly one of the most uniformative books on screenwriting I have ever read. Throughout the book Berman continues to pass on the knowledge that he has recieved through meetings with executives and through  other experiences as a screenwriter.The biggest problem with this is  that he has never sold a screenplay, optioned a screenplay, or even had a  serious meeting about having his work sold.  Thousands of screenplays are  sold, optioned, considered every year, how can you take advice from someone  who has failed for over 10 years?Berman throughout the book continues to  believe that his is the king of screenplays, and even though he continues  to be rejected time and time again, he insists that he is correct and that  executives (who are working in studios or agencies for a reason) are the  ones who are wrong.In this second edition, Berman includes one of his  original screenplays, Dead Man's Dance.  For some reason he believes that  this screenplay should have been picked up by some studio somewhere, but is  honestly not the least bit exciting.Only two parts of this book which  is worthwhile are a couple of the interviews included, and only a couple  because the questions asked to some of the interviewees are useless.  The  other useful part is the terminology and formatting techniques included,  but this can be found on many internet sites.I am only an ametuer and  started writing as a hobby because I love movies, but if you want to start  writing, professionally or otherwise, do not buy this book, the cover,  rear, and the chapter breakdowns are misleading, and buyers should beware  before being fooled by them \n",

This book thought I wanted to know how wheels were built by some German guy in that country in the 1970s-1990s, complete with pictures of him laboring in his shop and racers from that period of time.  Much of the information is irrelevant (musings on craftsmanship) or outmoded (how to ...twist and solder spokes?!).  The reviewer who pointed out that the book lacks a regular old wheelbuild recipe is correct.  The book is unaware that bicycle wheels can be made of carbon.Unless you love German cycling lore or want this book to recreate historically-accurate 1970's-1990s wheels, save your $20 and buy your local mechanic an espresso.

      " review: \"GKC\" was pushing 30 when TWELVE TYPES was pulled together in book form in 1903. It made his literary reputation among the cognoscenti of England.His little essays touch on one woman and eleven men. All twelve \"types\" are well known, although for different skills, including writing, thinking, brooding or kinging it.Charlotte Bronte wrote of plain people with big, sometimes tortured souls. William Morris found the 19th Century ugly and tried to reshape it in stained glass and cloth to evoke better bygone ages.Lord Byron wore many disguises, including pessimism. Robert Louis Stevenson was even more a man of masks. Alexander Pope knew, generously, that people worth satirizing had to have a core of value. He made his witty, wise couplets look easy. But no one who has copied him has been remotely so good.What did Francis of Assisi and Edmund Rostand share? They were great poets, first and foremost. Francis loved life and people more happily than anyone before or since. Rostand's soldiers dying in fear of the crows that would soon pluck out their eyes cheered for Napoleon one last \"Vive l'empereur!.\"That idlest but most despotic of Stuart Kings, Charles II, was a thorough sceptic. He was not just sceptical about this or that. He doubted everything. Even in turning Catholic and taking communion on his deathbed, he might muse, \"The wafer might not be God, similarly it might not be a wafer.\" Charles's restoration in 1660 was a revolt \"of the debris of human nature.\" Men of the Restoration, weak Epicureans all, were masters of killing time. Higher Epicureans \"make time live.\"Thomas Carlyle believed his message to be true and important but did not think it important to persuade others. Count Tolstoy saw the simplicity of \"mere Christianity\" but then tried to codify it in rules. Michelangelo was a friend of the austere Dominican Monk of Florence Savonarola and would gladly have tossed his greatest works into the \"bonfire of the vanities\" if he thought its flames signaled \"the dawn of a younger and wiser world.\"Finally, Sir Walter Scott. He is the eternal king of romance and romance touches the deepest core of human nature. First impressions are deepest. And boys are therefore right to pay more attention to Bruce's plume than to his hatreds. Sir Walter tells a story lovingly. He invites us to sip it like wine and not gulp it down like bitter medicine.TWELVE TYPES is a book to pull out of our pocket when the world grows too much with us. It is wise, consoling, provocative. It is over a hundred years old And don't we all wish that we could write something half so timely! -OOO- \n",

It synthesizes (in a sort of anthology-type format) the two most persuasive books I've ever read on the subject, including Peter Singer's Animal Liberation and Robbins' Diet for a New America.  Where both Singer and Robbins' deal with the animal abuse, health, and environmental issues behind the use of animal products, this book adds a spiritual dimension, which will uplift you even if you don't believe in a higher power.  I personally am a doubter or agnostic, but even this book got me to believe that if there is a God, this is the action \"it\" would want us to take to save our planet and ourselves.  If the Kafkaesque/Orwellian (but worse!) loathsome, inhumane conditions we humans have subjugated on animals doesn't get to you, hopefully the promotion of \"green\" ideas and human health will.  If none of those issues are of interest to people, well....I guess we deserve our fate.  But I think I have faith in the human race, especially after reading about the conversion of so many hunters and farmers to this cause.  Those were the most powerful essays in my opinion, and I wish all would read! \n",

      " review: The Lord of the Rings, The Avengers, History's hit show Vikings all share a common root inspiration in Norse mythology. Students in our classes are happily engaged in popular culture and because of that, teaching the myths of Valhalla is more relevant to them now than it has been in a long time. We as teachers must embrace this opportunity, and this book, Reaching Valhalla, allows us the chance to bring these myths to life to help our students see a connection between literature and popular culture. Hamby's reader's theatre format makes students an active part of the lesson rather than reading quietly on their own. Reading aloud is a great benefit to the whole class as it allows multiple voices a venue and as a teacher, we can pause at important moments for further detail and explanation. This means students are not left quietly wondering.The myths in this book are written with multiple speaking parts (about a dozen per myth) and can easily be adapted to include even more if you wished (I often have multiple students read one part if it is quite text heavy and I also like to have a student or two do the sound effects) and take about 40 minutes to read aloud during class. Pair this with the included anticipatory and post-reading discussion questions, a teacher has a great full day lesson. While the book does not include post-reading activities like essays, writing projects, or creative projects, I find creating activities easy to do when the lesson has been thorough and easy-to-understand. This is where this book stands out to me in that the language used is of today. These scripts have humour, an easy to follow structure, and fleshed out details that make them easy to understand. It's this style that makes the gods come to life for the kids.All the basic Norse myths and characters are here. The book has many myths that offer connection suggestions for the teacher, a teacher's guide for each myth that offers a summary of the myth itself and teachable terms. Mythology can be a joy to teach and to learn when the right tools are used, and this book is a tool you as an educator will want in your basket. \n",

(i've since downloaded the rest of his books.)donorboy tells the story of a 14 year-old girl, beginning shortly after the deaths of her two lesbian mothers in a car accident. \"donorboy\" is, well, the sperm donor who is, technically, her father, but has never even met her (he was an old friend of one of her moms'). but donorboy - who is in his young thirties and never married - decides to pursue custody of her, and wins.when the story begins, the two aren't even talking at all (only because she will not talk to him). halpin uses a creative collection of journal entries, emails, text messages, and meeting transcripts to piece the unfolding story for us (it's a brilliant literary device that would have felt forced in the hands of a lesser author).we get an insider's glimpse into the pain and tiny steps of healing in the mind and heart of a young teen girl. we see a father who is flailing and failing and trying and patient and second-guessing his own every move. it's an aching story of healing and restoration.in a long way back, halpin wrote extensively about grief through a middle aged female narrator (the sister of the man in grief). in this story, he tells a story of grief through the voices of a 14 year-old girl and a 30-something guy. fascinating. the guy certainly has an inside track on what grief really looks and feels like. and healing too.a great read for older teenagers, parents, and youth workers. but just a great read for anyone, really. \n",

      " review: This book is cute, compact (diaper-bag sized!) and presents a great introduction to standard ASL for babies, which I believe is preferable to made-up signs for a number of reasons.Another reviewer pointed out the inconvenience of flipping to the back to look up signs (indicated throughout with use of UPPERCASE to indicate a sign you should use with your baby).  However, I also noticed that some of the signs Briant mentions aren't included in the book at all - most notably, \"WHAT?\".This is a sign she refers to all over the place, yet it doesn't seem to be included among the 60 that she provides.I realize that a book this size has to limit what is included... and it definitely leaves you wanting more, perhaps a full-sized book to leave at home and this one to take on the road while you're just beginning to sign.I really like Briant's common-sense approach:  you don't have to start too young, make it fun, introduce just a few new words at a time - all of this is easier on baby, and definitely easier on YOU.But I did get the sense that this book may outlive its usefulness pretty quickly once you have both mastered the 60 basic signs included... and that the \"front-of-the-book stuff,\" the sales pitch for baby signing, is a little light & thin on details for repeated re-reading.I will try to report back in about a year, once I have an actual baby to practice signing on and let you know what my final verdict will be.  :-)))UPDATE:  She signs back!(a little)Have been using signs with my baby since 6-7 months, and last week she started signing back (a little)... (she's now 11.5 months).  We are still using just the ten \"beginning\" signs most systems recommend.  Basic things like POTTY, MORE, etc.  And last week, the baby signed MORE.  She can also sign MUSIC and is starting to put her hand to her head for BED when she's sleepy.  It is the cutest thing in the world and she is soooo proud of herself.Will update this review - hopefully! - in about 6 months. \n",

      " review: I enjoyed parts of the book, especially the introduction of Americans who ventured to Paris in the early 1830s.  These characters bounced off the pages into my interest zone. Knowing that many Americans ventured to Paris to study the arts and French culture, I realized I was not particularly interested in who these Americans were until I read McCullough's new book. I have now ordered writings of William Wells Brown, James F Cooper, Emma H. Willard and Samuel Morse, and I discovered several volumes of the life and writings of Charles Sumner in my own book collection that I will enjoy studying. None of this would have triggered my interest had I not read the book, The Greatest Journey.However, on the critical side, I am in agreement with another review that described David McCullough's latest book not as satisfying as others including John Adams, one of my favorites.  Obviously I enjoyed the vignettes of Americans, among others.  Also enjoyed learning of the historical events described. But, I found the ever ending tale of war and hardships in France sometimes redundant and even admittedly a bit boring, not to say they aren't an important part of French history, but I questioned the amount of time spent on subjects not particularly relevant to Americans living in Paris at those times. I would have rather enjoyed more about the lives of these adventurous Americans. The author jumps from era to era and event to event with very little bridging, therefore making it mind boggling to figure out where, what, when.  Perhaps this is why another reviewer found the book somewhat erratic.After the negative part of my review, I want to once again say that I enjoyed the book, and it gave me an opportunity to learn more about Paris in the 1800s.For sure, it's worth reading...just not amazing and spellbinding as I'd hoped. \n",

      " review: The untold story of how American schools were seized by the left during the founding of the U.N. and why society is falling apart now, all these years later. American children are being molded into citizens of the world and taught to despise the origins of the United States in the Revolutionary War, from the time of entering school.  This was done through the rewriting of the nation's textbooks, even as sex ed was expanded to fill the gap.  UNESCO particularly did not like the exemplary character of George Washington lest children should want to pattern themselves on him, so he was expunged from memor. Not a \"professional\" educator or historian, the book is written from her participation in Los Angeles in the early '50's to throw UNESCO out of the schools. Apparently successful as the school board voted it out, still the teaching went on, because UNESCO is not a subject, but an attitude and philosophy. \n",

      " review: If you were to walk the streets of London at the end of the 19th century, the topic of conversation you'd most likely hear people discussing would be either the recent grizzly killings of prostitutes by the elusive Jack the Ripper, or time travel. The later is all the rage due to two things. First, is the recent publication of a book by a first-time novelist named Herbert George Wells called The Time Traveler. The second is all of the handbills currently circulating throughout the city advertising actual trips in time to visit the year 2000. They're advertisements for a company called Murray's Time Travel which claims to have created the actual machine described by H. G. Wells and have now begun taking people to visit the future.Andrew Harrington couldn't care less about time travel. He's the son of a wealthy business owner and has just fallen in love with Marie Kelly. Unfortunately for him, the mortality rate for people in Marie's line of work has been rapidly increasing due to The Ripper. When Marie becomes the latest of Jack's victims, time travel takes on a whole new meaning to Andrew. Is it really possible now to travel backwards through time and is it possible that he could do it and save the life of the woman of his dreams?The story that ensues is fantastic! Felix J. Palma is a Spanish author and I think this is his first book translated into English and published here in the U.S. I can't tell you how pleased I am that he was picked up by a publisher here. He has written a book that defies an adequate description. The book contains three parts, each with its own set of loosely associated characters and a storyline surrounding time travel. Andrew's and Marie's is only the first of the three. My description of the story makes it sound like this is a science fiction book, and would only be enjoyed by those who read that genre. It's definitely much more than that. To say much more would give too much away. So I'll just say that I highly recommend this book to everyone. It's a tremendously fun read. \n",

      " review: A story of a young man searching for a way to distance himself from a world that offers only pain can be a common thread amongst many books, most notableThe Neverending Story, but author Dan O'Brien attempts to offer a more complex and modern twist to an old idea. I won't delve too far into the storyline given many a reviewer has laid out the complete story arc in their reviews, but I will make an attempt to offer more of an insight into the presentation of the book itself.First thing you will notice upon opening the book is that the paragraph structure is not justified, not the words that the pages contain but the actual format or layout of the paragraph does not follow the usual sentence stretching format common in almost every book produced in the last several hundred years. Even worse is that the common break up of long words with a - is nowhere to be found leaving some paragraph lines with a few words then empty page until the next sentence begins. I don't mean to harp on the books production value but a poor presentation can draw the reader outside of the books story and detract from the work of the author. Otherwise the book is edited well with only a few grammatical and spelling errors along the way.If you can overlook the publication errors, and most reasonable readers ought too, then it will not be difficult to be taken by the story itself. Many comparisons can be made to The Neverending Story and the beginning of the book does relate heavily to that book, but the author does offer a unique and refreshing look to the common tale. With the main character living a much more gritty life the author makes the story more modern to the world we live in now.The overall story is well thought out and written. The characters personalities are strong and offer the reader great insight to the lives they lead. I did find some of the transitions between the characters in need of some improvement as the main characters sound too much like the narrative. This common vocal dialogue between the authors narrative voice and the characters dialogue does retract from the characters overall development. With the main characters sounding like the author they can, and do, come off older and more knowledgeable than they should.I did enjoy reading this book. I can see some developing talent from this author and an ability to connect with the target audience. With the book being written towards a younger reader the story will be the focal point for the readers imagination and the errors with the books production will be better ignored.Good story and good read, needs some work but recommended for 10-16 year olds. 3.5/5.0 stars.I received this book at no charge in exchange for an honest review. \n",

      " review: My Review:  5 Stars, 3 FlamesWhen I read thatEnlightened (Love and Light Series)was kind of in the Yoga/Hippy/Guru business, I was not at all sure about reading this book even though it has my beloved Vampires in it.  Boy am I glad that I did not walk away because Enlightened is like no other book I have read...and I LIKED IT!  Basically, Melissa takes your hand and pulls you into her version of the supernatural world...and it's a series! ;)  Beware though because once you start reading it, you will not be able to stop!  Yes, it is that intriguing.The Good:  Loti is not only the primary character but she is an exciting and fresh one.  She was incredibly relatable.  The secondary characters help the story progress and Loti to grow.  I loved being surprised each time I turned a page and found some new and dramatic event.  I really enjoyed how Melissa interwove some Ghandi quotes as well.  It somehow seemed, well, right to have them in this story.  I also loved the ending.  It felt complete when I finished it but not without some ready tie-ins for the next book in the series.  This was just some incredibly good writing.The Bad:  Bad?  What bad?  I literally have no complaints.The Snuggly:  Wolf and Loti falling in love is a very tender and emotional story.  Their feelings for one another draw you into their love as well, in a way I have not previously experienced.  It is a truly special event.  And the sex?  Oh the sex was just fine, thank you very much.  Descriptive without being raunchy, it is an important piece of the puzzle for Loti and Wolf.The Rest:  As a debut book for author Melissa Lummis, I was unprepared for the depth of character and creative thinking that I found in Enlightened.  It is a book that  can be read over and over and I am sure will never become dull.  I would not recommend this for anyone under 18 but the rest of your paranormal romance lovers out there,this is most certainly the book for you!  5 Stars, 3 FlamesI was provided with a copy of this book in exchange for an unbiased and honest review.

      " review: In this writing, Mr. Labossiere gets straight to the point with each premise. There is no undue repetition or unjustifiable commentary. You get exactly what you need to have a clear understanding of what is being stated and you move on to the next idea. I LOVE IT!I loved the position taken by the author. Stephan Labossiere makes it clear at the onset that he is human. He repeats this notion throughout the book while also reminding the reader of his/her own humanity. I believe this realization is essential within a book of this genre. In reading books with a religious basis, one must always be reminded that the book and its principles are not equivalent to the bible and its principles. This correlates directly with another statement Mr. Labossiere repeats throughout the book, which is the fact that God himself should be acknowledged constantly as we make our lives&#8217; decisions.My favorite aspect of this book was the tone of the author throughout! I remember getting excited as soon as I started with the introduction! I could hear Mr. Labossiere making his statements in much the same voice as I would amongst a group of friends. I could hear his statements in friendly discussions and could immediately appreciate the openness with which he guides his own coaching clients and friends. For me, this made the book all the more authentic. His down-to-earth tone kept the reading lively and engaging. It opened me up to not only the examples provided but also caused me to readily apply the scenarios to my personal life and the lives of those around me. Great job Mr Labossiere! \n",

This wasn't actually surprising as he had shown her he could be a major PITA and had a string of short-term relationships. So when she is close to realizing her personal dream and gives her notice, she finds herself dealing with a change in their relationship that she never saw coming and the gloves come off.Needless to say, I freaking loved this book. The interactions between Chris and Lucy are hilarious. Both have strong personalities and while Lucy might be his assistant, she doesn't hesitate to put him in his place. This makes for a very entertaining read and some serious sexual tension. And Ms. Wood does not disappoint when these two finally get together.

Bick was in Afghanistan on Sept. 11, 2001, and gives a unique perspective on the impact of that attack and its aftermath on the people of Afghanistan. The book, informed by Bick's deep history in the feminist and peace movements, also focuses on the historic human rights struggles of women in Afghanistan.  The book is invaluable to understanding the challenges faced in shaping future foreign relations with Afghanistan and understanding the complexities of its society.

I stumbled across it in a book store and bought it because it said on the back it was a guide for young witches. I had dedicated myself to the great goddess about six months before, but I had no idea that there was an organized religion that was anything like my personal beliefs.I was wrong. Here, in this book, was everything I had known my whole life about the great goddess and the energy of the earth but had never known the words for. This book taught me everything a beginning witch needs to know, from the basics of spell casting to lists and lists of what corresponds to what in the magical world, and those lists cover almost everything.I can't recommend this book enough. It helped me so much-I don't know where I would be spiritually with out it. I suppose I would be very confused and frustrated, rather than just being a somewhat confused solitary Wiccan. But for a new Witch it's a guidebook for almost everything, for an old one the correspondences will be invaluable in spell workings. I also wrote thus author once, and she's very nice, and has a great web site for all things magical. \n",

      " review: What an interesting thesis! What would be the last supper of a series of fine chefs! Melanie Dunea, the author, notes (page 7): \"Chefs have been playing the 'My Last Supper' game, in one version or another, since humans first gathered round the flames to cook. . . . \"If you were to die tomorrow, what single dish, what one mouthful of food, would you choose as your last?\"And then, we see the answer to that existential question by 50 chefs.Anthony Bourdain says that his final dish would be: \"Roast bone marrow with parsley and caper salad, with a few toasted slices of baguette and some good sea salt.\" So far, so good. We see his recipe for the marrow at the end of the book, and it's a bit different!What about Mario Batali? He'd like his last meal on the Amalfi Coast, with his family and friends such as Emeril Lagasse. The meal itself? Eight to ten courses! Beginning with marinated anchovies, to a Neapolitan version of a grilled cheese sandwich, to . . . And on it goes. He gives us a recipe for one item, Shrimp in Crazy Water--but not the rest. Would have been fun to get the whole picture.Then, Alain Ducasse. He would begin with a coponata (a Sicilian specialty), then roasted quail in Madiran wine sauce, then smooth celeriac puree with nutmeg, and a finish with apple slices. Again, boy, I'd like to see all of the recipes, although his Melt-in-Your-Mouth Apple Slices, which is included in the volume, looks pretty good.And on it goes. It's kind of fun to see what these fine chefs would have as their last meal, whom they would like to done with, whom they would like to cook the meal, where they would like the meal to take place. I find this work enchanting. But, again, I'd sure like to see all of the recipes for those final meals, rather than the small selection. Without that, this seems just a bit incomplete. Still and all, this is a neat volume. \n",

I liked the writing, the connection between two guys is actually quite beatiful and as I said I found sex scenes (pretty much non stop with few pauses for story to take place IMO) to be hot, but I wished for more plot and for the plot that was there to cause me less eye rolls while I was reading. I was especially amused (not in a good way) by the actions of Micah's father the king.SPOILER SPOILER ALTHOUGH REALLY BLURB TELLS YOU THE WHOLE STORY IN DETAIL, NOTHING IS HIDDEN NOT EVEN THE AMUSING TWIST AT THE END OF THE STORYSo basically he was okay with not acting against agressor for twelve years!! But then he suddenly realized that his son who is now nineteen may die from plague and now he decided to act. Shakes head. I guess I just cannot suspend the disbelief for things like that, king would have been murdered or thrown from the throne long time ago if he would not have acted and put the wellfare of the whole country second. And then he acts (as if agressor would have cared who Eli was if he was caught) twelve years later as if it does not matter any more.I expect more logic in the story besides he needed to act when author needed the romance to begin. Three stars barely. \n",

      " review: \"Enough is enough\" offers a critical and insightful view of the world's economy.  What makes the book great is the timely and tangible perspective it provides.  Large problems are brought into scale through personal accounts, analogies, and fun What-If's.  Problems are presented and immediately followed by proposed solutions vetted by a large community of economists and thinkers.Conservatives and liberals alike agree: large forces influence the world economy.  What isn't always visible or agreed upon are the limits of the world economy.  I appreciated the book's step-wise dissection of how we measure prosperity and how growth as it is commonly measured flatly does not promote happiness and health.As a scientist (albeit in a different field) I look for solid reasoning and facts in any policy book.  I was impressed.  Each chapter presented clear data and analysis: growth limits have been reached or exceeded.  The reasoning in Chapter 8 in particular struck me.  Invested _money_ (as even I have in my bank, 401k, etc) can increase indefinitely.  But my money is worth nothing except in the exchange for physical, real-world goods and services.  However, money has no physical limit while the exchanged resources have limits defined by Physics.  World currency needs to be tied to resources.  Well said.While I hope conservatives interested in economics will read the book, I am left feeling that many who might identify themselves as steadfast capitalists will be turned off.  Perhaps an opportunity to \"reach out and convince\" was missed.That said, I would highly recommend the book for anyone interested in economics and for any undergrad economics or MBA graduate course. \n",

      " review: So many ready-to-use Italian cookbooks focus on one region of Italy and its native dishes. But to a real fan of the country&#8217;s cooking as a whole, a book like this is the best guide, as it selects several dishes from each distinct region.The easy directions and explanations for the varied selection let the reader develop a wide base of knowledge to later build upon, once the essential skills are honed. The chapters are easily broken down into courses, so you can pick and choose, from light simple meals made of several elements to a full 5-7 course traditional meal for a special occasion. It is a fantastic tool to add to a well-rounded kitchen and culinary repertoire. \n",

I bought this book after I saw Dawkins' name in the byline, and was very disappointed to find out that this anthology has no more than a few pages by the man. In fact, I didn't even realize that this was an anthology at all (I guess I'm not familiar enough with the 'Disinformation' series of books). Fine, that is my fault. But as one commenter noted, the articles are random, which is true, and unfortunately there is no continuity between them other than their portrayal of theism. Ultimately, after reading Dawkins, Harris, Hitchens, and Dennett, all extremely poignant authors with fantastic books, this read leaves a lot to be desired. \n",

      " review: James lives in a future where the country has undergone a major energy crisis, and life is much different from today.  He spends many years working close to Washington policy makers to influence the way the crisis is handled, and spends a significant amount of time searching for meaning in his own life.  He spends time forming a lasting relationship with his former boss, and even more time seeking real love from various women.Let me start by saying that for readers interested in economics, energy usage, and quasi dystopian futuristic literature, this book is probably a grand slam.  In the parameters of those genres, this book is well written.  And in general, I think that the author's writing style shows real talent and considerable promise.  However, this book just failed to hook me.At over 500 pages, this book could use some trimming.  For example,  at one point the male protagonist goes on at length, for many pages, reciting a lecture he plans to give to a college class.  I saw absolutely no point to having this lecture, verbatim, in the story.  In fact, I felt that the entire scene did little, if anything, to advance the story.  Similarly, there are a lot of sex scenes in the book that seem unnecessary.  Now, I am no prude, but sex for sex sake does not need to happen in a book of this length.  The sex scenes should, but rarely do, have a significant impact on this story.  Instead, it makes the protagonist seem like a sleaze, and made him very unlikable to me.I did not care for the main character.  I found him cold, particularly concerning the disappearance of his wife and child.  His story carries out on two timelines simultaneously, and while that method was carried out in a clear manner, I found very little of the action of the one timeline tying into the story of the second timeline in most cases, so it made the transitions seem a little forced, instead of flowing smoothly.I think that this was an ok book, that has the potential to be a great book, if only some of the subplot was removed and the focus narrowed.  Better yet, get rid of the simultaneous timelines, and make this a series about James' life.  The heart of the story was fine, there was just too much extraneous noise for my taste. \n",

And everything guys wanted to know about the \"stuff\" and our cravings for more and more of it.But as it stands, this picture book is nothing you want your family members to get a hold of.

Guadalcanal was the first invasion of Japanese held soil in the island hopping campaign that was World War II in the Pacific.  Hollywood actors,  William Bendix, Anthony Quinn & others were interspersed with live scenes of the war to perhaps humanize it &  add a little humor to a very grim place. Long before Iwo Jima, Okinawa & many of the other island invasions, The U.S. Marines proved that Americans could fight when provoked. Journalist Richard Tregaskis went ashore with the Marines at Guadalcanal. He wrote a book & it is his words used in this movie. if you never see another documentary you have to see this one.

      " review: In deference to Kent, I will keep this review simple.  When I first got my DVD Player several years ago, one of the movies on the top of my want list was Real Genius.  I couldn't understand why the movie studios were releasing so many mediocre films from their libraries onto DVD when great movies like this one were still not out.  I even wrote to the studio suggesting that they release it, but they responded that they had no immediate plans to do so.  Now, years later, it has finally happened.  Real Genius is coming out onto DVD.  Oh happy day!  I am elated at the prospect of seeing this comedic masterpiece in what I hope will be a fully restored form.I believe that some elements of the film are loosely modeled after Cal Tech and its students.  I still remember reading an article years ago about the shenanigans that go on in Cal Tech's dorms.  There is a widespread stereotype that brilliant people never have to study, and I appreciated that Real Genius showed that this belief is not true.  I also liked the fact that this movie showed that geniuses can have fun too.  If by some fluke, you have never seen this gem of a film, buy this DVD.  This is one movie that you will definitely want in your collection to watch again and again.  Because I no longer wear braces, I cannot say this with absolute certainty, but I think that Jesus would want you to own this DVD! \n",

But I was still baffled by this Manfred.  Thielemann seems to think he's in touch with noble spirits here, and one of them surely is Otto Klemperer, whose ghost hovers about the slower tempi inflicted on the piece.  I have to admit, at moments, I heard things I've never heard before, and some of them were nice to know!

      " review: Ornette Coleman was 29 years of age in 1959. He had made his debut album in 1958, entitled 'Something Else!!!!,' released on the Contemporary label. Coleman released two other albums for the Contemporary label before leaving to sign with Atlantic Records.The result was 'The Shape of Jazz to Come,' his first album to be released on the label and to this day, his finest. Produced by Atlantic Records executive Nesuhi Ertegun, the record featured six songs including what many consider to be his standout piece, 'Lonely Woman.'But believe me when I tell you, 'The Shape of Jazz to Come' is FAR more than just 'Lonely Woman.' All six songs are jazz masterpieces with Coleman blowing away at his saxophone, and featuring Don Cherry on cornet, Charlie Haden on the double bass, and Billy Higgins on drums.The record's six tracks are all masterpieces in their own right, but my favorite track would be the nine minute 'Peace.' Coleman is at his finest here, as is his backing group, in my opinion.So for people who haven't heard 'The Shape of Jazz to Come,' or have heard it but don't own it, BUY IT RIGHT NOW. This album is not only one of the finest jazz records ever to be made, but it is one of the finest records to be made PERIOD.This is an avant-garde jazz masterpiece. I can't say it enough, you don't have a jazz record collection until you have 'The Shape of Jazz to Come' in it.Overall, I recommend this album to anybody. It's an amazing record. If you like jazz even a little bit, than you'll love this album.Highly, highly recommended. This is a must-own for any jazz fan or any music fan in general.ENJOY!!! \n",

      " review: Taylor Dayne really cranked out some addictive, high quality, pulsating dance and R&B music in the late 80's and early 90's. Although Can't Fight Fate was paid more attention to and remains her most successful and consistent album, I never thought it matched the raw intensity and high octane sound of Tell It To My Heart. This album showcased that the 80's itself was ahead of its time in production and sound, there was also rigorous improvisation. This album serves as empirical evidence that the 80's and early 90's has surpassed the test of time better than any other era in music, period. Sure there is filler, but the singles are where Tell It To My Heart is the most cohesive and deserves its praise. The title track is the most distinctive and remains her trademark song. \"Prove Your Love\", the 2nd single, is quick paced and aggressive and contains some of the most relentless, energetic vocals I have ever heard on a dance album. The guitar solo is captivating and brings the song to its emotional climax. \"I'll Always Love You\" is classy R&B balladry is indicative of what would become of Can't Fight Fate and sounds equivalent to all her late 80's R&B contemporaries. \"The last single \"Don't Rush Me\" is my favorite track, a powerful message conveyed by Taylor's incredible vocals and incremental guitar soloing. This is Taylor Dayne's most universally appealing album to date and I recommend it to anyone who loves that fast-paced signature sound of the late 80's. Easily the most universally appealing album of her career. \n",

Their genius worked against them as far as the masses were concerned.  They were too esoteric for many.  This should been another reason to appreciate their ability and not attempt to sweep them under the shag carpet.Jeff Lynne, Bev Bevan, and Roy Wood would go on to great success with the Electric Light Orchestra but back in another galaxy there were great songs of psychedelia, pop, and a bit of rock that rolls titled \"Blackberry Way\", \"Flowers In The Rain\", and \"Fire Brigade.\"If you haven't checked out The Move in years or are finally taking the plunge (Good move) you must let the creative nature of the group grow on you.  Listen to the complete recordings straight through without any superfluous background distractions.  If the first listening did not make you a believer that is okay, this is common to many.  Don't file the music away.  Keep it playing and you will notice each time you hear one of their tunes they seem to get better and better.  The brilliance was there all along but it takes us humans awhile to adapt to the better things.The sound quality is fine.  Part of the charm of the 60's music and early 70's is the recordings have a sense of warmth and honesty and not a computer deciding how a mix should be presented.

If even the PICTURE of the arrow doesn't scream \"really hot device that's going to fall over in a .1 mile per hour breeze,\" then you're exactly the type who's earned the use of a dangerous toy.

      " review: I have to admit that Catapilla really did their homework when they recorded their second (and final) album, Changes in 1972. The band witnessed a lineup change, but vocalist Anna Meek and saxist Robert Calvert are still here. By the way, this Robert Calvert isn't the same Robert Calvert of Hawkwind. This Robert Calvert had later appeared on albums from the likes of Mother Gong (playing sax as with Catapilla), although it turns out the UK faction of Amon Duul did feature THAT Robert Calvert of Hawkwind, on the album Die L&ouml;sung, which was recorded prior to his passing, but not released until 1989, after his passing.Catapilla now added a keyboardist who included some low-key electric piano and organ, which I though was a nice addition to the band's sound. What I really felt made Changes a better album than their debut is Anna Meek. On their debut, she tended to scream and shriek, which she doesn't do that here making it easier on the ears. The band also mellowed out more, and I like the more experimental and atmospheric approach they do here. I heard comparisons to Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon, but that album was starting to be recorded by the time Changes came out, so there's no way Catapilla could have heard Dark Side of the Moon. Perhaps because of the mid-paced atmospheric passages and the presence of sax that's not unlike Dick Parry's use of that instrument on The Dark Side of the Moon that gave the Floyd comparison. Honestly, I really thought Catapilla had a sound like no one else's. There's that jazz-influence, but you couldn't compare them to Colosseum (who were Catapilla's Vertigo labelmates), and no way could you compare them to Yes or Genesis. So those who dislike their prog being unoriginal (not that I have a problem with that, as long as the music is well-done), you shouldn't have a problem here.Although I do think their debut is excellent, really it's Changes that is the better of the two and I highly recommend it. \n",

      " review: Disciple, God Send Death and New Faith are all fantastic. Listening to them makes you think that the album is going to be brilliant all the way through. However, there is very little else to offer. Slayer made their mark in the 80s for being by far the heaviest band of their day. They had a huge influence on what would become death metal and black metal and they showcased two of the fiercest guitarists in metal and a manic drummer (who was since replaced with somebody equally brilliant about 10 years ago, in fact I'd say that Paul Bostaph was even better than the legendary Dave Lombardo).But here's the catch. The band are still behaving like they are controversial and neccesary to the scene. Quite frankly they are niether. Most of the songs here are actually boring, simply covered up by the first three full-length tracks. Not only that, but the lyrics are simply awful. \"I keep the Bible in a pool of blood so none of its lies can affect me\"? I mean seriously, do they think they are making some sort of statement that hasn't been made already (and if it ever was neccessary then only in the beginning before Slayer were even born)? All that Slayer are doing is furthur adding to the myth that metal is Satanic - in the process giving the wrong idea of exactly what Satanism is anyway.One great thing about this album (apart from the few decent songs) is the production. This is one of THE best productions I've EVER heard on a metal album. If only it wasn't squandered. I also really liked Araya's vocals here. Very aggressive.Anyway, this does have some storming metal songs on it but Slayer should either find something new to sing about whilst reinventing thier music or give up. \n",

Still, no problem -- bought the wood separately at Home Depot, and assembled the workbench, with 2 helpers, in about 2 hours.  The workbench legs are plastic, not metal, but they are strong and light and were easy to work with during the assembly.  You can select the dimensions of the shelves and the 2 x 4 stringers to customize the size and shape of the workbench. Also, the brackets for the supplemental shelving allow you to custom-design that part of the unit as well.Assembly directions come in the form of pictures on a fold-out sheet of paper -- requiring some study before starting -- but very logical.I now have a very sturdy workbench in my workshop and am enjoying it. \n",

I don't know if the vendor cut the package  down to fit into a smaller box for delivery, or it was from a package with more brushes that had been cut down to the three I ordered. I wouldn't order from supplier again because the package had been tampered with.  I expect a new product to be in the original manufacturer's packaging, unaltered. Also the magnet size was smaller than my original brush heads.  They did not vibrate in the hand piece to clean my teeth the same as the originals.....were  they a counterfeit version or just the wrong model for my older toothbrush?

      " review: I'm going on 2 years with this remote and it has held up beautifully. What few have failed to mention is just how sturdy this unit is. It's made of very tough and rigid materials such as an alloy metal chasis to frame and support the control panel. I've dropped the remote many times and it hits the ground like a rock. It's a fairly heavy unit relative to most modern light-weight plastic controllers. The control panel shows no signs of wear and the plastic part of the chassis is very high quality with a nice grip-able texture.The remote is very easy to program, just spend time with the instruction booklet and play with it. You can program the remote for you needs in a variety of ways, you really can't fail. I consider myself an advanced user so I've been able to squeeze every ounce out of this thing. I've had a good time putting this remote to the test, it's worth the money just for the 'toy' factor.So what's with the 4 stars? Well...it eats batteries at least once a month and unless you invest in a charger (I haven't bothered since I have an endless and free supply of batteries), buy a membership to Costco and pick up a pack AAAs.In addition, the motion sensing system seems very finicky and unreliable. It works only here and there and I see no predictable pattern; most of the time I have to wake it up by touching the panel to illuminate the device. The buttons also take some getting use to and are something of an annoyance to my 'guests' who just can't get use to looking at the remote to find the button instead of thumbing for it.If you want a high quality remote with excellent functionality and aesthetic appeal, you can't beat the value. If you are looking for something a bit more traditional and practical, you should be aware that this remote's unique capabilities come with some trade-offs (tactile feedback and disappearing buttons).I recently retired the unit after upgrading to the newest Harmony 880 remote because of the rechargeable internal battery and PC programmability.If they release an updated version of this remote, I would easily buy another just to have it! You can beat the fun factor! \n",

The only filtration they used was the good old under gravel filter.Many years later when I decided to set up a new large tank, I found out that UG filters were not in fashion, and all the \"experts\" were recommending canister or other types of filters that hung on the back of the tank. After having one disaster after another with my fish getting sick or dying from a build up of pollutants, and also dealing with constant maintenance on these tank edge filters, I decided to go back to what I knew worked; the good old-fashioned undergravel filter.I have a 100 gallon freshwater aquarium, and I supplement the UG filter with a tank edge  mounted power filter. I have not had a bit of trouble since. I also like the water bubbles in the filter stems; very relaxing. I am glad I stopped listening to the experts and went back to a proven water filtration solution. This is a good product. It is heavy duty, easy to install, and effective. \n",

      " review: I bought the 1 GB model for $249, and the first thing to point out is that I could have gotten a 20 GB iPod for only $50 more.  But with the G3, I have an outstanding voice recorder and FM radio built in.  Sound quality is amazing, with a great range and incredible bass.  The player is tiny, with dimensions comparable to a Zippo lighter.  Although the iAudio U2 is more attractive and has the same features for the same price (and probably the same chip set), I chose the g3 beacause it is supposed to last 50 hours off of one AA battery.  The U2, on the other hand, uses a polymer-lithium battery that holds a charge for 15 hours, and when the battery gets old, you either have to spend a lot of dough to replace it or you're left with an expensive paper weight.Not only is the sound quality excellent in playback mode, but the voice recordings that you make with the built-in microphone sound very clear, too.  However, the microphone is fairly sensitive to background noise (i.e., when you bump or rub the case).  There's a line-in jack for recording from an external audio source, and I imagine that you can probably plug in a lapel microphone to minimize background sounds.The radio reception is fairly good.  There's also a built-in equalizer that allows you to customize the sound (with presets for rock, pop, jazz, classical, etc).In short, my complains with the G3 are fairly minor.  Yes, its more expensive than many other flash players out there, but few players have so many features, and again, the sound quality is outstanding.  And did I mention the tiny size and incredible battery life?  If you're looking for a mp3 player for the car or for just walking around, get an iPod, but if you want something that's truly gym-worthy, with a built-in recorder and FM radio, you probably can't do better. \n",

ITW ran six episodes of two hours each, INCLUDING COMMERCIALS, so the person who claims that there were 720 minutes in the original version is simply wrong.  This is a beautiful, compelling, heartfelt series that examines the dynamics of the 19th century in what was to become the American West.  The acting and the scripts are of very high quality, and every aspect of these shows is superb, from the costumes to the make-up to the settings.There's enough here telling you what this show is about that I don't need to go into that; just be aware that this version has no disclaimer about editing on its package, and that the times of the episodes are consistent with the original program.  I also own the version that was sent to the Grammy voters and the episodes are identical on those six discs to those on these discs.  Ask yourself why they would possibly edit the episodes sent to Grammy voters--it simply wouldn't happen.And to the person who says this is far too long to show in schools, think again.  We're in the middle of studying this work for the second time in a high-school class, and both times I've used it, the students have loved it, and they've learned more about this aspect of American history than they have in any history class.  They've also developed a great deal of empathy towards the Native Americans, as they hadn't before realized just how difficult and horrific a transitional period these years caused them.This also makes a great gift to people who appreciate high-quality film-making and compelling stories and great characters. \n",

      " review: Cinnulin PF combined with alpha-lipoic acid lowers the serum glucose readings of type 2 diabetics by about half as much as metformin (Glucophage) alone or pioglitazone (Actos) alone.  Combining generic metformin with generic pioglitazone remains the best treatment for most type 2 diabetics because the vast majority of type 2 diabetics are suffering from insulin resistance and not from lack of insulin. However, these two highly praised drugs (metformin and pioglitazone) will require a prescription.  Cinnulin PF is better than cinnamon because cinnamon has toxic inclusions which make it impractical to use for prolonged periods of time.  Type 2 diabetics who decide to go with cinnulin PF plus alpha-lipoic acid might benefit by also swallowing acetyl-l-carnitine capsules (prevents diabetic neuropathy), drinking green tea (slightly lowers weight and also slightly lowers blood glucose), swallowing psyllium capsules (prevents constipation and also slightly lowers blood glucose), eating 3 shiitake mushrooms daily (substantially boosts immune system), losing weight (reduces the amount of tumor necrosis factor alpha in their blood, the main cause of their insulin resistance), swallowing several krill oil softgels daily (prevents high blood pressure, diabetic nephropathy, and diabetic cardiovascular disease), swallowing one 2,000 IU vitamin D3 softgel daily (prevents diabetic cardiovascular disease), swallowing one 6mg lutein softgel daily (protects the retina during diabetic retinopathy), and eating Japanese natto or swallowing nattokinase capsules (prevents diabetic blood clots). \n",

      " review: I bought the Sunpack PZ40X about 1 year ago. It works well when it's mounted on top of my Nikon D5000 (DSLR). I just bought a Vivitar \"Dedicated TTL Off-Camera Shoe Cord\" so I could use the flash mounted away from the camera. The cord is 4 feet long. The Vivitar Cord's container says it's for a Nikon camera. The Item mounts easily onto the camera's shoe and the flash mounts nicely at the end of the 4 foot long cord. When I took my first picture the flash was not triggered. I tried \"fiddling\" with the flashgun, the camera and and the Vivitar cord.Is it possible that this model of Sunpack flash won't fire because it is NOT DESIGNED TO DO SO WHEN IT'S NOT DIRECTLY ATTACHED TO MY PARTICULAR CAMERA?I'd love an answer from anyone who owns this particular flash.Dr. Gene Hirschchirogene@nc.rr.com \n",

      " review: Got this heater for an approx 500 sq ft studio. Wanted a heater that would keep the temp above freezing overnight and of course heat the place up for working there in daylight. So far, it's been working fine.A few possible \"negatives\" for someone looking to buy this unit...1) The actual temp is not displayed. There are two knobs for heat, one is a high/low setting for power and the other is the high/low setting(s) for heat. So you have to \"gauge\" where the various temps are.2) This unit has produced good, steady heat, but not \"fast\" heat (since there is no fan). There is a comparable Honeywell unit that has a fan to quickly heat up a room, but that heater was on a long back order and Honeywell was a real pain to work with so I went with the DeLonghi.Bottom line, this heater has been fine for my needs and it was a good price. \n",

No, not the fuel filter, the darn tank.SO...  out comes the tank, which was a pain since it's behind the rear seats.  I first used a lot of hot water and simple green, followed by a quart of diluted pool acid to eat the rust.... just to be sure.THEN I followed the directions on the kit.  My 10 Gal tank used about 1/2 the tank sealer (I put it all in, but poured about 1/2 out after coating the tank.

      " review: I'm a spice addict, I admit it.  I keep 3 types of hot spices at work and poor hot sauce or hot pepper powder in my coffee, on my fruit, in everything I eat (except ice cream.... so far).This stuff knocked me out with just very small amounts the first time I tried it.  Now I'm slowly working my way through the bottle and loving it.I mostly came to look at these reviews because I was curious where this stuff rates on the scoville scale -One website lists it at 40,000 Scoville (seems way too low to me, though that's compared to Tobasco sauce listed at 2,500 scoville by the same site).  That puts it below all the \"Dave's... \" and \"357...\" lines of hot sauces.Just for comparison, most websites list cayenne pepper as 30,000-50,000 scoville, but I can pour large quantities of cayenne pepper powder (trader joe's brand) into my food or eat it raw with no trouble, just a mild burn.  And this 100% Pain is WAY BEYOND that.  A very small amount of it will make a large bowl of soup almost too hot for me.Also, Original Juan's website lists this stuff in the same category with their \"Da Bomb\" line of salsas, which all have listed measurements of 119,000 scoville upward.  That seems far more realistic to me than 40,000 scoville -If you're not sure you can handle this level, try the Pain 85% for a lil more flavor and a lil less heat.  I haven't tried that one yet myself but I hear it's a pretty significant heat difference. \n",

      " review: The car seat functions fine as a safety piece for in-car use, but looks awful when used as a buggy along with the chicco caddy. In the images on line and in catalogues it looks great. However in reality it arrives covered, and I mean completely covered, in large red, yellow and black safety instructions and stickers - which I can only imagine are not supposed to be removed.It took me hours to peel off all the labels on just one side of the seat, soaking each area in hot soapy water.  Only to realize all the same stickers where on the other side in Spanish!  Even if you manage to remove them all they leave dark cheap-looking marks on the plastic. The worse part is that, because these stickers have to be completely destroyed in order to remove them, you of course lose all the information they contain (and therefore have to note it all down first).  All of this important information needs to be contained in 1 brochure inside the product for future use.There is no way anyone would want to wheel their beloved new-born around town in that contraption covered in massive safety notices!  Two of the notices are even whelded on as part of the material and so cannot ever be removed.  This can't be an industry standard as other car seats and buggies available on the market look perfectly attractive and are not spoilt by having these notices splashed all over them.As I say, it's fine as a piece of safety equipment, but Chicco seem to have forgotten that the seat makes up part of their buggy option - and in this capacity they've turned it into the ugliest, cheapest looking one on the market.  Such a shame. \n",

      " review: Working in a museum myself, I really couldn't tell you why it took me so long to finally sit down and watch this movie. I suppose it might have been because, despite the interesting subject matter, I tend to throw Ben Stiller flicks into the \"seen one, seen `em all\" category, which didn't exactly put me in a big rush. Eventually I caved, and while Night at the Museum was by no means an awful movie, my feelings towards it never really elevated above lukewarm level, and I was actually very surprised at just how much this movie was geared towards children specifically.Obviously I don't need lowbrow potty humor to be incorporated into everything I watch, but knowing this film was written by Thomas Lennon and Robert Ben Garant of Reno 911 fame, I was looking forward to a certain underlying, adult-oriented cleverness that was completely missing. Not that I can't also appreciate a good straightforward family movie when I see one, a la Hotel For Dogs or Mr.Popper's Penguins, but it also seemed fairly watered down by those standards as well. I will say that the CG special effects were VERY well done and the general cinematography was fantastic, but story-wise there wasn't much to go on and any conflicts or plot twists were forced or without much consequence to begin with. (The museum possibly closing down was mentioned, what, once in passing? And the bad guy \"reveal\" felt tacked on post-production.) It was really just random hijinks for the sake of random hijnks without any purpose, which is fine if you're under 6, but there were few genuine laugh-out-loud moments for anybody else. Aside from looking pretty, nothing was really explored thematically to tie it all together which I thought was strange.I realize I shouldn't be docking points based on what I expected or wanted it to be versus what it actually was, but even taken on its own merits, it still could have been so much more. It was entertaining enough in the moment and I don't necessarily regret buying it blindly, but for as much praise as I had heard beforehand, I was prepared for one of those \"something for everyone\" type of films and was slightly let down on all counts. \n",

      " review: Save your money and time. Don't pull the valve cover. Don't buy these tools. I bought the cam gear clamp tool and it did not work well enough to be useful. Remove the spark plugs. Bring the #1 piston up to TDC per instructions. Use White Out or a dab of fast drying paint to mark a tooth and a matching location on the housing and engine block on all three gears. On my Ford ZX2 after removing the belt the cam gears moved a bit but were easy to return to the match marks. To keep them in the right spot, I shoved a piece of wedge shaped wood between the gears with my thumb to keep them stationary. Use a large screw diver or a pry bar to move the gears for any fine adjustments. After changing the idler pulleys, I started the belt on about 1/4\" on the top cam gears. Then worked it on about 1/4\" onto the crankshaft gear and the idler pulleys. Then I worked around all of them until it slid on. Remove the wood wedge and follow the rest of the assembly instructions. My engine started right up, and works fine. This is not rocket science.You Tube has some good videos on this also.P.s. bringing the #1 piston up to TDC is not really necessary, but if you get screwed up it is allot easier to fix without pulling the valve cover. \n",

But in order for this to work, I need what they call a \"Scaler\" in order to convert componet to RGB and work with my projector.Look at this website or ask them PRIOR to you trying any cable/device you aren't totally sure will work.LOOK HERE FIRST!!![...]Im glad I only wasted like $7.This cable is NOT to connect your VGA output to your Componet input on your TV.It IS to connect your Componet output from a video source(dvd) via VGA input on a COMPONET capable device (newer projector). Make sure that just because yours might say RGB that it is in fact compatible with componet!READ REVIEWS!I see so many that have thought this cable is intended for something that it is NOT intended for.Just because it says RCA does not mean it is Red,White,Yellow.If you think VGA contains audio signals (red,white) - then please put down the cables and call a professional before you get hurt.This is video ONLY - ONLY!If you're still reading this, just go to that link I gave.

      " review: I recently bought a Toyota Venza and splurged for the leather interior after many spills, pukes, etc, beat the crap out of my poor Forester's cloth interior.  The Venza is great, however, the second row seats are VERY deep and both my children's feet naturally swing forward, kicking the seat back.  Although the leather wipes up nicely, it was frustrating to be constantly cleaning the scuff marks.  I didn't want to get seat covers (which saved my Forester!), so I was thrilled to find these kick mats.  THEY WORK PERFECTLY.  I had no issues installing them- my seats are fairly big so I was concerned.  They very easily slipped over the seat.  The bottom strap tucks in nicely.  They don't stand out as \"mom gear\"- they are very subtle.  It was a cheap and effective way to keep my car looking nice.  It also reduced the \"Can't we ever have anything nice for more than five minutes?!?!\" feeling.  Everyone can ride happily- my car stays cleans and the kids do not have to fear crazy mom when they accidentally kick the back of the seat.  A true win-win. \n",

You will definitely want to purchase the memory card on amazon as well because the 32MB memory card that comes with this camera will hold maybe 15 pictures or so.  The 2GB memory card for only $10 holds about 1000 pictures.When this camera arrived to me, I turned it on and it asked for the DATE and TIME.  But when I powered down the camera and then turned it back on later, it again asked for the date/time.  So the camera was not saving the Date/Time.  I opened the battery cover and their is a slot for the CR1220 Date battery which is as small as a watch battery.  IT WAS UPSIDE DOWN.  The + symbol of the battery was facing up and in reality, the - symbol needed to be facing up.  After I flipped around this 'watch battery', the camera was able to save the Date/Time and it never again asked me for the Date/Time each time I started it up.  I wrote to Canon and requested they retrain their staff with this issue since it caused me alot of headache.  Overall, the camera works great!  Large LCD screen, easy to handle, uses only 2 AA batteries and has 5 different resolutions to choose from when taking pictures, including a widescreen resolution and a Date/Time stamp selection so the date/time get stamped onto each picture you take.

      " review: I got this game a few months ago now.  I love the FF franchise, in fact it was this game that finally helped convince me to get a PSP.The thing you have to realize is that it is NOT a typical FF game (I've played 7-10,12) It is very different.  every version of FF I've played has a certain period of learning how to play the game since it does change but here are some of the major departures from what I am used to.(so far at least) Zack is the only character you play.  although you get to meet and interact with other (some faves from FF7) they never join your \"party\"While there are some mini games in town areas you do all your shopping from within the game menu.  this is convenient, but does take some of the fun out of exploration.While there are plenty of diversions, including missions which I'll get to in a second, and the movies are pretty awesome, it does feel like you're stuck within the story framework.  Ie there is no opportunity to explore the world map.  In fact there isn't one.the missions are this games answer to side quests, all conveniently accessible from within a save point menu.  These missions are certainly fun, especially when you just want to hack & slash and not deal with the story line for a while.  However, they can be somewhat tedious and repetitive after a while.  but then since I often have to remind myself where the heck I was in the game maybe I just played the missions too long.Sometimes the fights seem ridiculously easy, so much so that when a fight comes along that is truly \"normal\" or at my level, I have a hard time with it, having gotten used to the easier battles.  I started the play on \"normal\" mode not realizing that would be the only opportunity to change it.  I think I will try the harder mode next time. \n",

Good luck with yours!-----------------------------Original--------------------I just don't get it. What is the purpose of a triple blade razor bought at the supermarket? Why was I using that? It just doesn't make any sense now.I am looking at the way things are with this new way of shaving and all I can say is it's amazing. There's no more razor burn... No more itchy face. No more pain. I bought this razor and the 7AM shave. I have African American hair and skin and thought razor bumps were just a part of life. I WAS WRONG!At first I was bad with the razor using the wrong angle and hacking up my face.... But now... Now, I'm getting good at it and well lets just say there is no battery operated vibration that could give a smoother more comfortable shave. This is either an amazing DE razor OR all DE razors are amazing. BUY it and try it! It's ridiculous how much better this is than the triple blade competitors like mach3..3 \n",

While that is true, the instant version definitley loses something in the translation from brewed to instant, though I hear that's common.

      " review: The best wallet I've had in my lifetime was a Gold Pheil I purchased at Malm Luggage in San Francisco, CA 30+ years ago.  That's right folks, that German-made leather wallet was absolutely fantastic, and so was the price at the time - more than $100.00, but worth it.  When my Gold Pheil finally gave out some five years ago I attempted to purchase another one, but to no avail as Gold Pheil is no longer imported, and Malm luggage went out-of-business in 2012.  So, I purchased a Hartmann wallet, made by the same people that make luggage.  Well, let me tell you, not only was the Hartmann expensive, a bit more than $100.00 five years ago, it did not hold up for very long.  The major problem was separation between the leather and the man-made rayon, or whatever the liner was made of.  Quality of stitching, I suspect was the problem.  And the liner was splitting also.When I saw this Bosca Old Leather 12 Pocket Credit Wallet and read the reviews, I decided to take a leap on faith and buy it, and I am glad that I did.  Not only is the wallet roomy for all my credit cards plus other items I carry in my wallet (back pocket purse, really), but the construction (so far) has lived up to the hype.  The quality of the leather, while not the same as the German Gold Pheil, appears at this point, six months in, to be of sufficient quality to stand up for quite a long time.In fact, I like the quality of this wallet so much, both the leather and quality of construction, I purchased a second one (before Bosca cheapens the line down, which I do not know that will happen but I'm going to have a current-manufactured back-up on hand for the day when this first one becomes unserviceable).All-in-all, I am very satisfied with this purchase, and recommend it to others.  Never mind the price, if the quality is there, it will be a bargain!  Four stars at this point because I haven't had this wallet that long, but so far, so good.  If I am still using this wallet five + years from now, I will upgrade to 5 stars. \n",

The website says that sugar is added, so I was prepared for the fact that I would have to pre-soak and drain off the sugar from these.

You do lose some pineapple flavor but not much. You get to keep the enzymes and antioxidants however, which are not lost in the process. If you want to store them for longer than 2 weeks, you have to dehydrate them again.These pieces are not worth the work. I bought these about 7 months ago and still have a few bags left.

      " review: Rose and all the other seven junior fairies at Mistress Lily's Fairy School were preparing for their first exams.  Marigold wanted to study with her, but they'd probably end up talking so she decided against it.  Rose was reviewing her \"wish-granting notes\" and practicing her vanishing skills.  Of course \"There was always an elbow or a fingertip left visible, glowing faintly green.\"  Violet was an expert because her grandmother taught her before she came to the school.  It was going to be hard to study with Bink clattering around.  He was the \"type of fairy called a brownie\" and he was acting out of sorts.  He was mad that someone had been doing his work.  Brownies got miffed if anyone tried to do their work.Brownie began to tell Rose about his troubles.  Cook claimed that the butter was better than ever, but Brownie hadn't made it.  Cook was mad because someone had set the bread dough to rising and the \"frosted hazelnut cookies sitting on the counter\" were better than he could make.  Bink and Cook were fighting and Bink would lose his job because he was being blamed for being the secret baker.  Hmmmf!  Rose sympathized and said, \"I might be able to discover who the secret baker is.\"  Of course Daisy couldn't \"even boil water\" so she was out, the triplets were \"baby crazy,\" not foodies ... just who could it be?  All the flower fairies began to be suspicious of one another and Marigold, who was \"somewhat plump,\" began to be the object of their suspicions.  Rose was determined to find the culprit and set up a midnight watch, but she was not in for one surprise, but for two!The mystery of how Rose and the flower fairies set out to find the mysterious baker will awe the young reader.  Rose, who is the most elegant of the eight flower fairies at Mistress Lily's Fairy School, also appears to have a knack for solving a mystery.  Of course when she announced \"I have a plan for catching the secret baker red-handed--or flour-handed,\" I knew this nine year old Nancy Drew was going to catch the culprit.  I love learning about the little world of the flower fairies at Cloverleaf Cottage, including the fact that they \"are barely two inches tall.\"  This is the third book in the Fairy Blossoms series that will keep even the most reluctant reader racing to the end to figure out who's whipping up those scrumptious treats.  As Rose says, \"fringe and frippery, frocks and frills ...\" this is one mystery that's sure to thrill!This book courtesy of the author. \n",

After leaving the therapy center, the person was trying to keep up their therapy by lifting a can of soup, but these little dumbbells in the 1 and 2 pound size are better because the plastic coating and shape allow the user to get a better grip than you get on a round can.  So less chance of them dropping the weight and maybe hurting themself.Each level of weight is also a different bright color which makes it easy for the older person to see/ keep track of, and also adds a little colorful fun to exercising.  It's hard to find really small dumbbells in athletic stores so I was happy to find them here at a great low price.As others have said you get a single dumbbell, not a set of 2, so if you want 2 you have to order 2.  For my parent it was fine to just have the one because they won't be lifting two at a time. \n",

      " review: Unlike one of the other reviews currently posted, I had not fed this food to any of my cats before the formula change.  I would agree that this is fairly soupy, but the cat I fed it to ate it readily.  Since he does not normally like fish, I am counting this as a success.My typical procedure for introducing a new food is to offer the food for one meal on the first day and again on the second day.  I figure this is the true test -- if the cat will eat the food on the second day, after having had it once, it is probably something the cat will eat going forward.  I took the second half of this can of food out of the refrigerator, spread it out over a plate, and microwaved it for 15 seconds.  The cat in question ate about 90% of the microwaved food (and another cat was VERY excited to finish it up for him).So.  The cats like it.  It doesn't smell too bad.  It's not grain free (has brown rice) and it has a few more vegetable ingredients than I'd prefer (potato starch, spinach, flaxseeds, cranberries, sweet potatoes, carrots, blueberries).  However, as part of the rotation in an otherwise healthy cat's diet (don't feed this to kitties with inflammatory bowel disease, and this does have some chicken in it, so don't feed it to cats with chicken allergies), it's probably all right.  This is somewhere in the 3.5-4 star range for me. \n",

For a desktop which has 4 Gigs of ram and a fast system drive the speed improvement is noticeable but not major except for those times when several apps are opening at once like at startup.

      " review: Bought this mouse assuming it had an internal, rechargeable battery, given the included tether.  Received the mouse and at first was totally confused as to how to get it to work.  It turns out you have to provide TWO AAA BATTERIES which are NOT INCLUDED WITH THE ITEM.  (You insert the batteries by sliding back the cover with the iMicro logo on it).  This fact is totally omitted from the listing, which is very deceptive.  Also, there is literally no documentation included with the mouse, so it's up to the user to figure out how to use it - which actually turns out to be NOT AT ALL INTUITIVE.  The way to get the mouse to work AFTER inserting the batteries is pretty straight forward: just plug in the included dongle, and the mouse should sync up automatically (if not, just push the small round button inset on the underside of the mouse along with the button on the dongle and the mouse should sync up no problem).  If you want to use the mouse without inserting batteries (i.e., tethered), the process is very unintuitive and the setup cumbersome (you'd better have two free USB ports open on you computer): you first have to plug in the dongle, and then attach the tether to the mouse and another open USB port.  That's right, you have to use TWO USB PORTS JUST TO USE THE MOUSE IN TETHERED MODE.In terms of the actually functionality of the mouse, it seems to work fairly well.  The optical sensor is quite good and the response time is excellent.  The construction of the mouse is actually fairly sturdy despite it's many other shortcomings.  The scroll wheel turns smoothly and is quite responsive.  There is also a small port in the back of the mouse in which you can store the USB dongle when not in use.  Keep in mind however that the mouse will turn off when the dongle is inside (not that it matters anyway, since you can't use the mouse without the dongle in your computer.Final summation:  this is an okay mouse for anyone looking for a quick and dirty portable wireless solution, and you probably won't find much better for the tune of $9.  However, it certainly seems the manufacturer could have put a little more effort into making it more user friendly and compact: specifically, providing SOME instruction as to setup, and making the mouse work via tether without having to also plug in the dongle, taking up two USB ports where it should really only be necessary to use one.Also, I don't care HOW cheap an item is, Amazon should provide clearer specifications as to pertinent details of a product, such as the fact that this mouse requires batteries that are not included with the item as shipped. \n",

Two little kids running around the house, so the units had to provide good warmth - safely.I agree with many of the positive reviews for these heaters and we are going to keep them, but we'll probably tethered them to the wall or secure them in place somehow.

      " review: I live in a townhome complex, so I realistically just need to shovel out around my car and about 60 square feet of sidewalk (when I'm feeling especially kind to my neighbors.)That is, to be blunt, too big of a job for this shovel to take on, at least on a regular basis.  As soon as I get a bigger one, I'm putting it into my trunk as my go-to *emergency* shovel.  It works REALLY well - I probably moved something like 50 cubic feet of snow with it yesterday, and I was able to get all the way to the sidewalk (even though I went out to parts of the sidewalk where no one had shoveled, and so it was dealing with compact almost-ice rather than snow.)I even managed to cut down the big icy barrier created behind my car by the snow plows - the thing works really well.  And it's not heavy, which is AWESOME, and I was able to keep a good grip on it even with wet gloves.I'm just saying it's not supposed to be your main snow shovel.(I am thrilled I have it, though, because I can think of at least four major snow/mud crises I've had while driving, that wouldn't have been crises if I'd had it at the time.) \n",

      " review: Had it for a bit over a week, and this thing simply works.  I haven't set it to record shows, but it works fine just to watch tv on my laptop.  The included antenna is not the best and I had to move it around a bit to find a spot with best reception for all the local channels.  I tried a very similar Hauppage product, and while this unit looks and feels to be made on the cheap, it does all that the Hauppage unit did for half the price.The only negative is that it gets pretty hot, which doesn't really bother me and doesn't disturb anything, but at the same time makes you wonder how much current it's drawing from the USB port.A couple points that may have gotten it the few negative reviews I've seen here.  First, you have to run the drivers setup (I used the enclosed CD) as Administrator on Windows 7.  The other thing I noticed when I brought this to work to catch up on some things in the evening while watching TV--you need to set monitor's refresh rate to 60Hz, otherwise the picture is jumpy.  I found the later by googling for it, so always good to google first, before writing negative reviews :) \n",

      " review: I purchased this item last year for an investment property.  I read mixed reviews ( I tend to be optimistic, usually discounting people that sound overly negative) and I decided to go ahead and assume the risk since this seemed to be the energy efficient way to go.  I was really excited and I read the instructions thoroughly.  I went through all of the proper arrangements for installation, crossing all my t's and dotting my I's, I like to be thorough.  I upgraded my gas line from the meter to 3/4&#34; and I even had the gas company come out and ensure that I was being provided adequate gas from the meter to the home.  Everything checked out.  I purchased the expensive vent system for this kind of heater along with the service valves.  Altogether this was a big investment in both time and money.  I had the temperature set at the recommended setting and kept scratching my head as to why it would take a while to kick on and keep a consistent temperature.  It worked on and off. It would go cold in the middle of operation.  My tenant was very uncomfortable and complained.  I came and tried troubleshooting numerous times.  I checked the company's troubleshooting guide with no luck.  I even tried calling this stupid company many times and never got an answer during business hours.  So I convinced my tenant that perhaps it needed a break in period to work properly.  I exceeded Amazons return policy time and the worthless company who makes this never got back to me.  Even if they were to fix it I could not have my tenants go without hot water that long.  So I ended up buying a water heater tank.  It worked just as one would expect.  Even if I sent this heater back to Eccotemp, I would never go through the cost of installing this thing as I would not trust its reliability and I rather save myself the money and time of installation.  I am bitter, yes.  This is my experience.  Perhaps there are others who are lucky and happy with their product but I am hoping one more bad review will shed some light as to exposing an inferior product and company who's quality control is lacking. \n",

However, there is no stake in the crimp and so they came off with just a pull with my hands.Removing the heat shrink on the other cable revealed that about (estimate) 15% of the wire strands were cut and not even in the connector.  Not good.Otherwise the cables are quite flexible, measure right at .325 inch (AWG 0) and have thick insulation.I would recommend looking at the Streetwires cables instead.  Their 0 AWG measures larger than 00 AWG (but it's copper covered aluminum) and the crimps are solid. \n",

The third lasted a number of weeks longer before it was also unusable.For years our company used only Tanita scales, they give us the accuracy we need - at a cost of about $400 per unit. As sales grew and our scale needs increased, we experimented with a variety of brands to determine if we could find the precision and dependability we require - in a lower cost scale.The My Weigh GemPro 250 Compact Jewelry Scale turned out to be a completely wrong turn. Our experiments were successful however, we found what we needed in the American Weigh GPR-20 scales. In our tests they were able to replicate known weights better than the the My Weigh GemPro, and they are showing far superior durability.Based on the experiences at our company, we have concluded the My Weigh GemPro 250 is a product to avoid. For us, it was not as accurate as other scales in its class, and the My Weigh GemPro 250 was the least dependable piece of equipment (of any kind) we have ever purchased.Kudos to the American Weigh GPR-20, which we find to be more accurate and far more dependable - at half the cost of the My Weigh GemPro 250 Compact Jewelry Scale. \n",

      " review: Anyone who's ever seen a \"Mega Disaster\" episode knows it's one of The History Channel's most ambitious series - as well as one of its most \"apocalyptic.\"  You hear the expression \"when, not if\" at just about every turn.  This is my favorite History Channel series - which is why I'm willing to buy it even though I've seen every episode; but even I find myself thinking every once in a while \"Hey guys, tone it down just a bit, ok?  We get the picture.  This is bad stuff.\"  This trend toward the apocalyptic is so firmly entrenched in \"Mega Disasters\" that even when the episode itself contains scientific testimony downplaying the odds of the disaster happening, they still can't help making the prediction \"it will happen, it's just a question of when.\"  Case in point: the \"Windy City Tornado\" episode clearly states that the kind of Super Tornado outbreak causing a tornado to hit the Chicago suburb of Oak Lawn in 1967 was a once in a century event - followed by the same predictable dire prediction: it could happen tomorrow.What you get here is a \"Cry Wolf\" situation which actually undercuts the far more immediate dangers posed by some of the potential \"Mega Disasters\" - such as that presented in \"The Next Pompeii.\"  The evidence clearly shows the city of Naples, Italy to be at serious risk should Mt. Vesuvius erupt again, backed up by evidence that Vesuvius has alternated since the 79 AD eruption between major and minor eruptions - and that it's time for a major eruption.  This is truly a \"when, not if\" scenario.The best two episodes feature more generic disasters: \"Mega Drought\" and \"Mega Freeze.\"  These are tied to climate change but don't engender the standard \"when, not if\" paradigm.  Nonetheless these are the most harrowing in that they involve huge areas rather than specific locations. \"Mega Drought\" would hit southwest and mid-west America hardest; \"Mega Freeze\" would hit eastern United States and Europe hardest.The History Channel has pulled out all the stops in their computer graphics and scientific assessments for this series.  Needless to say, there's danger and action enough for even the die-hard sci-fi enthusiast; but it's not \"in your face\" action: rather, it's tailored to assaults by nature rather than by alien invaders. You get scared out of your wits - but don't have to endure the hero or heroine stumbling over a tree stump while trying to flee the monster.  How good is that! \n",

      " review: I owned a CRT 32\" TV that had just about given up the ghost. Initially I bought an Insignia plasma tv, 42\" 720p, for $424. Was quite disappointed with it. When up close, you could see a small amount of space between the pixels, it was just not bright enough for our family room with lots of windows (except at night), and I was just not satisfied with the resolution. Returned it to Best Buy where it belonged.Enter the LG 42\" LCD-LED 1080p 120Hz TV, which I purchased with the free blue ray player for a total of $764 after pricematch: worth every additional penny, and then some. The picture is bright and even, the resolution and sharpness is excellent, none of the plasma pixel spacing, and bonus blue ray player. The magic remote is also pretty cool, allowing you mouse like function using the hand-held remote that seems to have a gyroscope in it. It even comes with appropriate sized screws to attach to a wall mount unit if you buy one. Turn off the auto brightness feature for sure, and pick up a few cheap HDMI cables on EBay. After watching blue ray on this TV, I could not go back to my old CRT, or the plasma TV for that matter. Lots of HDMI ports, USB ports (and also includes wifi dongle to connect the Tv to the internet; you can also connect a HD or flash drive to it), component and composite port, digital audio out, analog audio out; you will not lack connection types.Even at a higher price, I would not regret this purchase, and would strongly recommend it to a friend. Put down the plasma, this is for you! \n",

      " review: I plan on getting a memory foam mattress in the next couple of months, and while this is hardly a good way to sample what I'll be getting, I've never had any kind of memory foam topper or mattress of any kind prior to this one by Sleep Innovations. I have to say that I wasn't that impressed by it, though the pillow is definitely the better of the two items here. But even then, you can get a really good memory foam pillow for less than what this set costs. This would be ok for a guest room or something, but for anyone who wants a memory foam topper to last them a while, I'd look elsewhere.The topper is an inch thick, and is easily scrunched up if you move around a lot in your sleep. Regarding the comfort, I honestly didn't get anything out of it. If anything, it took a few nights to adjust to, but once I got used to it, I didn't feel any better sleeping on it than I did without. The pillow fares much better, and while it's not as good as the Sleep Innovations Molded Memory Foam Pillow I bought a few weeks ago, it's a heck of a lot better than many others I've bought over the years. Mine didn't arrive lumpy, and it retains the same general shape and feel after many uses. The fact that it's machine washable is an added bonus since a couple of memory foam pillows I was looking at before ordering the one I did mentioned that they were surface wash only.Also included is a carrying case for the topper, a nice bonus. It's not necessary but if you end up liking it, taking the topper along with you while on a trip is nice. I also have to mention that this set comes shipped in a stupidly huge box, which contains the actual product box inside. I laughed out loud when I opened the huge box, only to find a much smaller one inside with the topper and pillow. Were they in that much danger during shipping???I can't recommend this set, and would suggest that you go for something better if you're looking for long-term memory foam goods. At the same time, you could do worse, so this is middle of the road to me. \n",

      " review: I love how this rug looks and feels. It is the perfect size for my space, and the shag is really cool. However, ever since I unrolled it onto the floor there has been this STRONG chemical odor that has been filling my condo. At first I didn't think too much of it, but then that night before bed I was struck with quite severe nausea and a horrible headache. I have since googled this issue, and apparently it is common for \"cheaper\" rugs made of synthetic materials to emit chemicals and toxins including formaldehyde! Needless to say, this is NOT what I thought I was getting into when I bought this rug! It has now been over a week and I have had fans running and all the windows open in my condo the entire time. The smell has STILL not been completely aired out. I really don't know what to do. The smell is making me sick (despite having the windows open and fans on) but I love the look of the rug. So, purchase as your own risk! A reviewer on another site said the smell did not bother her, maybe they're not all shipped in the condition that mine was. But if you get a rug that emits toxins into your home, good luck dealing with it! It has NOT been fun, and not what I expected for four hundred dollars!! \n",

      " review: Once again, Miss Buroker produces an entertaining tale of adventure and danger in her sequel to 'Flash Gold'.  Kali  has managed to set up another shop with her new partner, Cedar, and things seem relatively calm for them until Kali's old beau shows up with a business proposition and Cedar gets wind of his long-time nemesis being in town.  Of course, mayhem and chaos ensue and the two of them soon become caught up in a deadly situation.I think one of my favorite aspects of this series is how the characters find their way out of tight situations: not with mere brute force (which Cedar could get away with considering his excellent marksmanship), but by also thinking things through and using the laws of physics to outmaneuver their enemies when all odds seem to be stacked against them.  I was also happy with the further development of Kali and Cedar's relationship in this book, as well as their growth as individuals.  The reader is shown a brief glimpse into their pasts and we finally get to learn Cedar's real name. Also, the arrival of a new threat, an old business partner of Kali's father and her own intriguig inventions, helps set up a new challenge for Kali and Cedar they'll have to face in (hopefully) future books.In conclusion, the character development, once again, is up to my strict standards; the action is, if not constantly present, always looming in the background waiting to thwart our heroes; we get another fun invention or two from Kali (I especially like the spud gun at the end); and the reader is introduced to another formidable enemy who may or may not have survived the battle at the end of the book.  A very entertaining read indeed!  My only question is: how long will we have to wait for 'Flash Gold' book three? \n",

      " review: We love this tub.  We've been using it for six months (our son is a little over six months old now).  Our first experience with the tub was doing a sponge bath in the sling.  Our son was not a fan of that.  After awhile we added water to the tub while he was still in the sling.  This was much more pleasing for him.  Once he grew out of the sling, bath time might be his happiest time of the day.  He loves the vibrartion.  He will splash in the tub for long stretches of time.  Sometimes we just let him splash, spend less time bathing and more time letting him have fun.  We will be a little sad when he's able to situp in the full size tub and have to retire this one.  Have never had any problems with this.  Love that you can hang it to dry.  Is easy to fill and empty.  The headrest is pretty flimsy, but baby never complains.  Highly recommended!! \n",

      " review: I've seen Phantom of the Opera in NYC, as well as the recently released blu-ray recording. This latest effort of Andrew Lloyd Webber just doesn't measure up to his earlier work. Sure, the sets are spectacular, costumes were top-notch, and musicality was excellent. I don't fault any of the cast or crew here.Webber's music compositions here just feel uninspired. Chord progressions are so predictable and and bit bland. Lyrics fare a bit better, but there's nothing new here. There's a reason this musical only lasted 18 months in London.I'm a fan of Webber, but I hold him to a high standard. This is not up to par in my book for him. I don't care what Webber lovers here say regarding this sequel (it's crazy to rate this 5 stars). It IS a sequel to Phantom of the Opera. By now we all know how sequels to almost anything fare these days. The track record isn't pretty.Regarding the blu-ray quality, overall video and audio is excellent, but there are way too many editing cuts to different camera angles (like a rock concert) instead of shots of the entire stage so we could enjoy the impressive sets. I know this video was filmed to allow audiences to experience close-ups of the actors and to get more of the emotion they're trying to convey, but there were too many unnecessary cuts to different angles here. Some camera operators struggled to keep a few shots in focus as well.There is one special feature (making-of) that was mediocre. It showed some backstage shots, but also used footage from the show itself. Basically, this was more of a love-fest for the Australian production and cast instead of a true making-of production of the musical itself.I'd suggest a rental before committing to buy, except for the die-hard Webber fans. \n",

      " review: The author seems to have derived a plot that other authors have shied away from for fear of alienating Earth's most populous nation and, potentially, most lucrative marketplace.On the other hand, the writer substituted stereotypes in several of the key roles, resulting in a good read, but not a great book. In the old days, character arc was not so common in novels, partly because books were limited to only about 200 or so pages. Nowadays, however, character development is THE major factor, which is why books ballooned to 400, 500, 600 pages. With Amazon Kindle and Apple iBooks, etc., number of pages is less critical to trees. But, use those pages to develop real characters, at least for the three or four central stars of the story.Mind you, Vaughn Heppner will sell a lot of books if he keeps writing this quality of story. But, he won't rise to the stardom I sincerely believe he can achieve if he will develop original characters who laugh and cry and ache and love and whom readers can become invested in.Other than that advice, in light of the great number of reviewers Heppner has already attracted, all I can say is, I also am a fan who is interested to observe this writer's career, for I am confident he will be as prolific as Isaac Asimov and Stephen King.Like many other reviewers, I've already purchased several of his other novels in this series. \n",

I went on a two-day hike and in a few places, the shoes are starting to become unglued. You have to look closely, but TWO days of wear only.I'm completely blown away, because this miserable quality is not what I expect from New Balance. \n",

While story and characters could have been a little better developed, the original ideas were enough to sell me.  Also slightly jarring clash of modern and primitive with respect to technology and character language and attitudes.  Would be good if that could be smoothed out and made a little more consistent somehow.  1 star for the horrible, painful spelling/grammar/malaprop errors.  Please, please get a good editor and re-issue a fixed digital version update.  Also, with a new cover.  The current one is so terrible it really made me not want to give this a try. \n",

      " review: I got and assembled this yesterday. Here are some thoughts for prospective buyers (since the only other review on this seems suspiciously vague and all positive):Pros:- Cheap- All pieces arrived in good condition/labeled, no missing screws/parts- pieces fit reasonably well together when assembledCons:- Though the Particleboard seems fairly durable, the glue job on wood laminate is not. Easily came off at the ends.- Assembly is NOT easy. Ideally you'll need two people for at least a portion of it.- Foul chemical smell on the boards. I wiped the boards with all-purpose cleaners but the smell is still there and may require some time to vent off.- shelf is much smaller than appears on pics. Despite knowing the dimensions ahead of time, I am still a bit shocked by how small it is.Overall, you're getting what you paid for. This shelf doesn't look like it would last super long, but is should suffice for 4-5 years of gentle use, probably to be disposed off when you move.The only real concern I have is the foul chemical smell, as this is a made in China product and I dunno if that chemical will linger or is toxic. \n",

The one thing I did not expect, since the drives were touted as being essentially just like the Mac Super Drives,  was that the disc is not inserted directly into a slot in the drive, but rather you have to open the drive's tray, insert the disc into the tray, and close the tray again.

      " review: We have 2 dogs and 6 cats that all share the same water bowl. They are all indoor/outdoor pets.I have tried other watering fountains of this type and they were very flimsy.  Not this one: it's very sturdy.With the others we also had problems with splashes (mainly because of the big dog). This has high sides and we rarely see water now - well, except if the one cat decides to get his head and paws in it and pretends it's a bathtub!  LOLMy husband and I both have back problems so the size of the reservoirs is perfect for us.  When they are filled, we can easily carry and insert them.The filters seem to work fine. Granted, we have bottled water that tastes great to begin with, so the filtering probably doesn't have much of an affect as might be needed when using tap water or water from a hose outside.Note: The filter is for keeping the water clean/clear: it is not designed to keep debris out of the water.  For example, if the dog has been digging around in the yard and has some small pieces of dirt on her mouth and drinks some water, those little pieces fall to the bottom of the basin: they are not picked up by the filter.  It's good practice to clean a drinking vessel anyway - and we just do that with this unit.I cannot really provide input about the pricing since we haven't had it that long (since January 2013). I would expect it to last a year or more without problems.  If it does, then I consider the price to be appropriate. \n",

The scissors are good and come apart for cleaning but the addition of a can opener at the ends actually feels awkward in my hand.The block is nicely finished, about average size. But the set seems to be missing a knife. I would like one between the 4\" paring knife and 6\" sandoku knife. There are plenty of times I want something larger than a paring knife but not as big as the next one up.I'm no expert on knives but I know what feels good in my hand and I like it when I don't have to struggle to cut through something.

I just unpacked this modifier and am not at all happy.This softbox was very appealing: the grid, two diffusions, the flash bracket, great price.I had high hopes that the manufacturers would have been reading the comments posted by Amazon customers and would have made requisite corrections.Let me tell you that just hasn't happened.As other reviewers have mentioned, this unit does not come with instructions.(1) The speed ring has twelve possible receptacles for the four rods which shape the box.I get that each pair are supposed to be opposite to each other.  However I was not willing to risk ripping the vinyl that the box is made from and being unable to return the thing.A little direction here would not have cost the manufacturer much.(2) The four rods are supposed to fit in sleeve-sockets at the open end of the modifier.Three of the sleeve sockets were in place; the fourth was missing/stitched over.(3) The ring of the flash bracket is NOT the one depicted in the photographs used in the Amazon advertising.(4) The notches on the flash bracket ring do not in any way align with any part of the Bowens-style speedring.Even if I was to waste more time trying to puzzle out which four holes to use in the speedring, I still wouldn't be able to mount the flash bracket to the speedring.My time (and yours) is worth more than the aggravation and time lost buying this carelessly manufactured, carelessly packaged product.I will contact Amazon about returning this nightmare.  If something changes, I will update this review.>>>>Update:I called Amazon who gave me the seller's telephone number.Richard answered the phone and was very helpful:1) Regarding the rods on the speedring:  You need to use the two which are closest together (on each opposing side).2) The missing \"rod pocket\" is designed that way. That is the last rod which goes in to place and uses the velcro from the outside of the package to close over.3) Richard acknowledged that they had put the wrong bracket in the package and is sending a new one by priority mail.4) There was a bit of hemming and hawing about why there were no instructions in the box - nothing satisfactory though.IF the bracket shows up in time for me to use on an upcoming shoot, I will keep this soft box.  Otherwise...As has been mentioned elsewhere, this is NOT what you want for location work: it takes too dang long to set up.I think there is also a safety risk inherent in this design: the rods are under a lot of tension.  One mistake and someone could easily damage an eye during assembly. \n",

Most of this book does not even talk about weight-loss,  it talks about being happy and \"finding your calling\".

That's his entire weight-loss plan.  Doesn't even talk about what thin and healthy people do,  just that if you think it then I guess you magically start doing what thin and healthy people do.If this were advertised more as a \"be happy, smell the roses\" type of book, then I would have less of an issue with it.

      " review: So I started building this back when I wasn't that great with modeling. I'm still not, but, looking back, I probably could've done some things differently.Still, this kit isn't snap-fitted, so you'll need some glue. Tamiya Thin Cement should do the trick. It's made of softer plastic, so be sure you don't press too hard when gluing them together.The ship isn't hard at all to build. There are about a handful of pieces, and should take half an hour to an hour, depending on your skill level. And yes, they are unpainted, so there's that as well.All in all, though, it's a great representation of the classic arcade ship. And the box art is absolutely beautiful. Should you desire to double up and get the two ships, since there's only one per kit, the instructions include more than one paint color guide at the back. Pretty neat. \n",

      " review: The Jack Quick 3000 HHD-1000 is a great trailer jack for our 20 ft. horse trailer. We busted our manual jack by driving off with it only lifted an inch off the ground. The hole in the trailer tongue was pretty close to the same size as the new electric jack so I had to saw off the bottom of the manual jack to get it out. The new electric bolted right in. The instructions say to use Grade 5 bolts (not included) and torque to 10-15 ft. lbs. A set of star washers was included and the instructions said to use them to bite through the paint on the jack so there will be a good ground connection to the trailer.  The only wire to connect was a 10-gauge stranded conductor with about 3 feet of length and a fuseholder which included two 30-amp fuses (1 spare). (I will measure the current draw and update.) The instructions say to connect the 10-gauge wire directly to the positive terminal of the battery. I used the little 12V 5AH sealed lead acid battery inside the trailer brakes breakaway controller which had very small tab terminals. The little battery by itself was able to power the jack, though I wouldn't plan on running it up and down more than a couple of times between charges. (It charges whenever the trailer is plugged into the truck for towing.) It is not very speedy, whether plugged into the truck or not (I will time it and update this review) but the fine treads and motor generate plenty of force to lift the tongue. There is a plastic cap on top of the motor that you must pry out with your fingernails to access the manual jacking screw. There is a large slotted screw that mates to the included handle and allows you to raise or lower the jack very slowly without electricity. It was packed well in cardboard and styrofoam, so it arrived in perfect condition. \n",

      " review: One of the great things about movies is that they can take you to places and times you will never see.  Some are imagined, and some are real.  And some are a mixture.  Frankly, I've never given much thought of what became of children, presumed to be innocent, of Nazi Germany's evil establishment.  Well, \"Lore\" gives you a look.  Based on an interview (Blu ray extra) with a woman who was in this situation as a child, this is an honest look.As the Allies swarm Germany and Hitler is defeated, Nazi officers and their families head for the hills.  In the case of one family, the father and mother are captured and imprisoned leaving their children to fend for themselves with little more than the clothes on their back, a bit of money and jewelry.  Lore is the oldest at 14 or 15 and is played by the striking Saskia Rosendahl in one of the most memorable performances of 2012.  She has an 11 year old sister, Liesel (remarkable Nele Trebs), twin brothers and an infant.As they make their way on foot and eventually by train, to Hamburg where their grandmother and aunt live, they encounter a teenage boy who has eyes for Lore.  The boy helps the group get past American soldiers by showing his Jewish papers.  Seeing what she believes to be a sworn enemy, Lore keeps her distance.  This is a difficult film to watch and could have fallen into pretty standard fare.  But director and co-writer (with Robin Mukherjee) Cate Shortland doesn't let the romantic angle control the story.This is a story about survival.  A story about privileged children having to grow up fast.  The bleak fortunes of the children is counterbalanced by some terrific photography thanks to Adam Arkapaw and the film has a wonderful score by Max Richter.  While the movie is dark and sometimes hard to watch, it is a remarkable piece of filmmaking and I can't say enough about Ms. Rosendahl. \n",

Regardless, with most set ups, the adapter is needed because the Galaxy Note 2 is MHL 1.0, not 2.0. From what I know, for the Note 2, you will need an adapter for all types of wired connections. Most of these setups do not charge the phone. I believe the S4 is the only phone that does not required a power adapter BUT the cable must be MHL 2.0 rated.Up to 1080p means you will get a 1080i with the Note 2. However, there is no lagging and every action done on the Note 2 moves flawlessly on my TV. I've read about others, on different devices and connections get 1080p but its very choppy. Because its so damn 'real-timish' I can accept it.Quality of the cable sucks. The cable is crimped (pressed) with plastic peeling by the terminal.Pros:Its a cheap, uncomplicated solution considering so many people are having difficulty connecting the Note 2 to their TV. It really is plug and play for the Note 2.Notes:Be sure you have your TV image scaled properly (no stretch or zoom). \n",

      " review: We have owned this game since last August 2013 and it has been one of my grandson's favorites.  He just loves the fact that he can fight other monkey opponents and for him he has a blast playing it.  You get to customize your monkey and as you fight his skills improve but so does the quality of the opponents that you are matched against.  The objective is to knock out your opponent.  You throw punches with your right hand button and block punches with the left hand button.  When stars appear you quickly touch them and you get to throw extra powerful punches and stun your opponent.  When a wheel appears you and your opponent throw haymakers like a windmill and the faster you spin the wheel the faster you throw punches. Ultimately you either win by KO or you can lose.As I mentioned my grandson loves this app and has played it a lot.  At the end you get a score sheet showing all the ways you gained points.  The graphics are colorful and drawn very well.  Good detail and cartoon quality realism.  The audio is also OK and if it gets on your nerves you can control the volume.The more you fight the more your abilities increase.  Your strength, endurance and speed improve and you will need it as the opponents also get stronger, faster and can fight longer.  As you play you can also unlock achievements for winning boxing matches.  You can touch the dice to roll them and it will randomly pick a dress up for your fighter and perhaps add a Mohawk and different color fighting gloves, shoes and trunks.Overall this is a fun game and like I said my grandson loves it.  It plays well on his Kindle Fire and on my Android tablet.  The game play does get repetitive and it involves a lot of finger tapping.  Children don't seem to mind it though and have a good time.The more button does take you to the Apple App Store, Google Play store or to the Amazon app store.  You should know this before your children start buying a bunch of new games.  The app has no adware, malware or invasive permissions.  It does use the internet for Amazon licensing and for using the more button.  The app also reads and writes to your external storage.  It automatically stored itself on my SD card memory.  I turned off the WIFI and the game still plays.I rate this game at 5 stars for good graphics and kids just love it.  Its finger boxing with great graphics!  Playing it is always fun and it puts a smile on your face. \n",

A tiny penny piece of plastic broke off, out fell the wheel spring, and that was it for the XV-11. It happens all the time, apparently, to many XV's.

Comparing this to the XV-11, it has a better air filter, but the battery life is MUCH shorter and somehow the navigation isn't as smart as the XV was. Thus, 3 stars. \n",

      " review: I received my kit a week ago.Over the course of 3 evenings I put it together.  If you get one of the newer kits, make sure that the directions from the website that you are reading are for the LARGE motor Simple -- they are not the same as the directions for the older Simple on the website, and you will save yourself some of my mistakes if you get the right ones the first try.Once everything was put together, I spent the next 3 days getting it to work properly.  Once I figured out that the screw on the back was for the Z end stop, calibration was pretty quick.  I had some X and Y slippage, but was able to use the tensioners to tighten the fishing line, which solved the problem.  Make sure your hot end is in enough -- it doesn't really go very easily into the extruder, but it needs to be all the way in for the screws to hold it in place.  And I strongly recommend printing a filament guide for the top of the extruder -- that took my printer from jamming every 5-10 minutes to being reliable for at least 2 hours (the longest print I've done so far).  I also strongly recommend using blue painter's tape on the print bed.  I had a really bad time trying to get my prints to stick (finely sanded duct tape with a lot of aquanet does work, more or less) because my shipment of painter's tape was delivered very late.  But once it was in, it worked like magic.The point of detailing those problems is to highlight the fact that this is a do-it-yourself kit, not a works-out-of-the-box appliance.  You learn a lot about how 3D printers work building this thing yourself, and I had a lot of fun doing it.  Once everything is working properly, you can spend your time searching Thingiverse for small objects to print (I've done Christmas ornaments, a cookie cutter, a small spaceship, etc.) and dreaming up 3D objects to design yourself.  As an introduction to a hobby, this is a great place to start. \n",

While I did not learn anything groundbreaking I wrote down several ideas I have thought of and never put into action.  Just acting on one of those ideas will put thousands of dollars in my pocket.  If you want to take back controll of your family's future and quit being one of the many that ensures Wal-Mart will be king of the hill killing jobs and draining resources then read this.  Several years ago my family and I spent 4k to 8k a year at Wal-Mart.  Today we may spend $700 and that is usually because it's last second and all other options for buying is closed!  I believe that we are to blame for the unemployment issues in our country and we need to take responsibility and keep the money we spend in our community helping our neighbors and making our friends and neighbors financially well off and by doing so you can also ensure you are also financially well off also. When I speak of local I am not just talking about your small town or general living area.  Today I consider anyplace.within a 2 or 3 hour drive local and sometimes anyplace in the country meaning the USA. Sam Waltons kids have plenty and can live without us giving them anymore! \n",

      " review: I bought an 11 lbs. box from Amazon. The look and texture reminds me of light brown sugar. It packs and molds very well just like beach sand. I do recommend using a sand table because it does get messy and falls on the floor when my kids play with it on the kitchen table. Just like regular sand it gets everywhere except this stuff clumps together like play-doh which to me makes it not as hard to clean up as regular sand although there will still be grains of sand left behind here and there. It does not stick to your hands unless they are dirty so I make sure my kids wash and dry their hands very well before they play with it. One thing for sure...the sand will get in your fingernails. My husband and I enjoy playing with it too! If you want to buy Waba Fun kinetic sand I suggest you do your research because sometimes these sellers on Amazon can be a bit over priced. Sometimes you can catch it cheaper on ebay as well. I also bought two 2.2 lbs. cannisters of Brookstone sand from the Brookstone store and I believe I can say with certainty that Brookstone Sand and Waba Fun kinetic sand are the exact same product. Everything about the two are identical...they are both made in Halmstad, Sweden and both have the same patent number. Both products look, feel and behave identically. Brookstone Sand does cost more but I suppose it is because the sand comes in a storage container, where as the Waba Fun kinetic sand comes in a box with non reusable packaging. If you wanna buy it in larger quantities I'd go with the Waba Fun because it is cheaper. I bought an 11 lbs. box for $54. The largest quantity of Brookstone Sand I've seen is 2.2. lbs. @ $20. You'd have to pay $100 to get 11 lbs. Although Waba Fun 2.2 lbs. box of kinetic sand is cheaper...I've seen it as low as $16...if you're only buying small quantities I'd go with Brookstone Sand only because it includes the storage container. \n",

A story such as where the food from and how is this specific food is good for you.The step by step how to cook the food is good and easy to follow since the ingredient to how to prepare a food and how long should we cook them.

      " review: I liked this collection more than the authors 'Lincoln and Kennedy' collection, maybe it was nearer to home? It had a more modern feel, but still in old fashioned a Housman/Whitman/Eliot feel.Like the other collection injustice seems to run through most of the poems, and the author makes several explicit points to what we learn from History - if anything at all?My favourite was the short Sweet and England is*... I particularly liked the second stanza: Instant hereos everyone/to press and politicians safe at home/a weekly roll-call of celebrity in death/A macabre black top hatted return/through somber weeping public streets.It is worth reading just for this poem alone.It reminded me of that great Belle and Sebastain song 'I fought in a War.'My only criticism, as with the other collection, would be the length, only 9 poems!

      " review: &#8220;Positive Thinking: Empowering Yourself with 30 Ways to Spend 30 Days in Positive Thinking&#8221; is a short self-help book about the power of positive thinking. It explores the benefits of positive thinking (improving your life, including your friendships/relationships and overall happiness) and sets out a month&#8217;s worth of advice for employing the positive thinking in your own life. Some of the advice includes completing affirmations, choosing to be with and inspired by positive people, meditating, and considering the feelings of others in advance.I liked the book&#8217;s friendly, common-sense tone, and each of the 30 pieces of advice is very doable, especially if taken one day at a time. I especially liked the way the author reframed certain mindsets; for instance, seeing problems as having both solutions and lessons, rather than just being obstacles to overcome, is a very helpful way to look at difficulties. I also liked that the emphasis of the book was not on drawing tangible assets to yourself (like many positive thinking/law of attraction books promise); instead, the focus is on how if you&#8217;re positive, you change not only your internal thought processes but also how other people perceive you, thereby strengthening relationships. The focus was also on being kind to others and giving of yourself as a path to happiness, which is a positive and refreshing message. Recommended to those readers who enjoy self-help books and are trying to see the glass as half full. \n",

We have 9 kids so it's important that whatever they use is nice and strong.  This net has held up really good not only with the kids, but also with the super high 50 mph winds that we have a tendency to get out in the country.  Nets are easy to switch out and the size is pretty decent. Not super huge, but a good, solid size. Great for a &#34;normal&#34; backyard without taking up too much room.Pros:size is perfect for backyardeasy to switch netsrebounder works great for individual playregular net is deep/large enough to feel like you are defending a whole netVery sturdy and holds up well against wind and kids galoreCons:Would have loved an extra frame along with the rebounder net so you wouldn't have to swap them back and forth for different needs; it puts more wear and tear on it switching it constantly. \n",

      " review: In this game you are traveling through the kingdom and finding items that are lost.  They can be tools that you use to solve the mystery and restore the kingdom to its former glory.  The game has a map and also a hint system that can help you if you get stuck. You touch the screen and move through the graphics to find the items.  If you touch the right areas you zoom in and can for example lift a rock and find a hidden key.  The graphics are good but some of it is rehashed from other games from the same developer.  I own several of their games and recognized graphic screens right away.The hint key is in the upper RH corner for your use.  It will become your friend.  On the bottom of the screen you will see the collection of the items you have found and if you touch them you can pick them up and try to use them to solve a puzzle that you are working on.  There is a back arrow that also helps you back out of an area that you are in.  In the upper LH corner is a square with a star on it that shows you the map of the kingdom and it will help you navigate through the app.  There is a home button in the lower RH corner to take you back to the main screen of the game.Touching the hint button will provide you with a clue and sometimes they are really cryptic in their help.  If you touch more help you can go to a YouTube walkthrough of the game.  To see your notes that you are taking automatically, as you travel through the kingdom, you go to the maps and in the upper right hand corner you will see your journal.  Touch it and you can see your notes that will help you solve more complicated puzzles in the game.I like the game but it is fairly short.  Once you master it the replay value is not very high.  This same developer has developed several games like this. It does contain remnants of code for Flurry but the internet connection is off and so it does not send out any data.  Flurry can be used in this case to monitor your game progress and report any game failures back to the developer.  Since the game does not have internet access I don't see how this can take place.  The game does read and write to your data storage area. There are no other permissions requested so it is not gathering data based on its allowed permissions.  It does not contain any adware plug ins. It does contain Facebook interfaces in the code but you have to allow access permission for it to work.The graphics are simple but nicely done and the music is OK and it did not bother me. I rate it at 4 stars \n",

      " review: This author is creative, exciting and always keeps you entertained. But...she clearly needs and editor or beta reader.Lukas and Nicole meet when his company does work for hers. Nicole is a 'b....!' However, she happens to be a single mother to a young adorable child. Lukas is brought into her life through her child.  Nicole doesn't like Lukas and she treats him horribly. Nicole is disrespectful and just down right angry at the world.One night, Lukas is the hero and saves Nicole's daughter from harm's path. Nicole doesn't really thank him, she continues to treat him like crap. Lukas stands up to her and in that fight their relationship begins.They have great sexual chemistry, but Lukas has a lot to overcome because of a death in his family.  He's not willing to concede to the things that Nicole secretly wants, like kids.Nicole does the unthinkable and Lukas is angry. Their relationship struggles from there and one of them must admit how they both feel.Pros:Chemistry. Lukas and Nicole are a hot couple. He pours off the pages.Lukas is an alpha male.Nicole's daughter is adorable.Realistic story line.Plot isn't bad.Cons:GRAMMAR! It's not pretty. This is a 4.5, but I hate re-reading a passage for clarity. Even her synopsis at the end of the book has grammar mistakes. WTH! She's talented. A very talented author, but if she wants to reach the next level she needs a beta reader or editor.Why was Nicole so angry? Never really understood why. \n",

      " review: I have never played a Kirby game before, so this is my first Kirby experience. I am almost done with Stage 4, 30% completion rate.The first thing that grabbed me were the graphics. This game is so full of color and intricate details! You have a gorgeous background, which you often have to play in. In other words, you have your standard path, but then you will use a warp star to go into the background, or back of the level (far away). You are constantly scanning the background for secret areas or items, it really is fun! I feel like I'm playing in 2 different worlds in each level.The background has a lot of interaction. Enemies will fire at you from the distance, swing back and forth, you have to dodge rotating pendulums, etc.I have not found the game to be that easy at all, Kirby takes a pretty decent hit from enemies and recovery items do not recover that much, and not generously placed (its just right). You cannot simply run through the levels, it takes careful maneuvering if you want to discover all the secrets.If you collect a certain number of \"hidden\" sunstones you can unlock extra stages. I have immensely enjoyed redoing the stages with differing abilities, hunting down the stones. Normally I do not care to collect everything in games, but I want to with Kirby :)I can do a stage multiple times and its still fun! This surprised me.My personal biggest challenge has been getting the ability I need from 1 stage, surviving it through the next stage where I need it to get to a secret area (You may need bombs from one stage to blow up blocks in another to access a door). However, if you get hit you lose your ability if you cannot swallow it within a few seconds, or it falls off the stage!So I really disagree with any reviews saying its too easy. Maybe for former Kirby players, but I am new.The music is a joy to listen to. It gives me energy and has a sense of urgency, it almost makes me feel like the levels are timed (but is not!).I find myself constantly smiling at the charm and cuteness that is Kirby. While swimming, he wears a floaty and goggles. Of course there is also all the various hats, adding to the cuteness. I am now officially a kirby fan!Edit: I cannot see 3D, so I don't know how good it is. However, some level designs make me feel like enemies and items (like trains) are going to come out of the screen!Random notes: I am an adult female gamer and typically enjoy platformers, some action-rpgs (Castlevania), Pokemon, and survival horror. \n",
