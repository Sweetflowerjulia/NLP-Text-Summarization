      "You may laugh, but I have found that Otherland volumes 1-4 are poor at picking up debris around the house.  I once spilled some cornflakes on the floor, and foolishly thought that I could clean it up by dropping &#34;City of Golden Shadows&#34; on it.  Not only did it not clean, it managed to make things worse by fragmenting the cornflakes into smaller and smaller pieces.  I did what any normal person would do: I stacked the other books on top, hoping that the combined power would whisk the cornflakes away to the technological wonderland that is Otherland.  No such results.Bin Otherland Empty, on the other hand, works like magic.  If you hook it up to a powerful enough motor, you can banish those cornflakes to the land of wind and ghosts.  The downside is that it's pretty light reading, but given the young adult trend these days it's following the light reading trend that literature is headed for these days.It's recommended that you get through the previous volume though (&#34;Hoover Electrical Vaccum Unit&#34;).  I mean, Bin Otherland Empty does work as a stand-alone, but it's not quite as absorbing when not paired up with the prequel.  Some people think you can skip the previous volume and lust stick your mouth in at one end and suck, but, c'mon, that's just gross.Spoiler alert!  Cornflakes vaccumed up.\n",

I come to this topic from both a Christian background and intellectual skepticism. But in the past fifteen years I have been exposed to and come to see the value of several forms of oracle and divination as tools for tapping into the subconscious as well as whatever one chooses to believe about the unseen energies and spirits possibly involved. I have often experienced remarkable outcomes and guidance from Runes, I Ching, and various forms of Tarot Cards, and have come to trust and value my own gifts of intuition. It was exciting to see what I have experienced with \"divination\" and oracle tools so well summed up and explained.This is an attractively laid-out, beautifully illustrated book that is impressively distinct from many coffee-table type overview \"encyclopedias\" on various subjects for actually having something useful and insightful to say. So many of these type of books are rushed into print to take advantage of popular (and superficial) interest in a given subject and are mostly cheap eye candy with shallow content and often misinformation. What impressed me most about this book is the author\\'s knowledgeable and balanced presentation. He is not dismissive of religion, but he is forthright about how religion and mainstream culture have repressed alternative realities and methods throughout history. This book is not full of gushy New-Age-speak.

It is not Orwell or Huxley, so expecting the writing to fly off the page and create a vivid, disturbing world is completely unrealistic. That said, the writing was oftentimes slightly disappointing when compared with the other novels.Getting immersed in the novel is troublesome: it is halting and stuttering for the first half. Roth seems to have lost her rhythm and keeps throwing the exact same obstacle at her characters disguised as different problems (A rebellion here... a rebellion here... a rebellion here... a rebellion here... it is an interesting look into a country that's collapsing, but it becomes quite too predictable).As interesting as it was stylistically to switch chapters between Tris and Tobias's point of views, that creates a disjoint: there is none of the continuity of the first two books. Once you're immersed in Tris's narrative, her chapter ends, and suddenly you are forced to remove yourself from her brain and try to enter Tobias's head. Also, the style of voice for each character isn't quite differentiated enough to really allow this separation to fully take place. There were times when I would forget whose head I was in, and it was simply because the style did not change enough to move me from one to another.However, having finished the book, the conceit makes more sense. We had to have a look into Tobias's head.As for those who disparage Roth for ending it the way she did, I, too, was disappointed. Yet Tris always did things true to her character: things she had done in the first book and in the second. There was no other way for Roth to end the series and have Tris remain an authentic person. Sure, we all want a happy ending, but doing so would be a cop out. How likely would it be for a sixteen year old girl to survive all of the things Tris has survived? Not very. Add that to her self-sacrificing tendencies and what you get is exactly what Roth wrote. Was I angry? Yes. Heartbroken? Definitely? Did I spend the last eighty pages or so of the book crying, wiping my eyes, aware of what was going to happen? Yeah. But then again, I'm a writer, and as a writer, I would have been extremely frustrated if Roth had ended it happily for everyone. That's simply not realistic.So while I am sad that I didn't get the storybook ending a la The Hunger Games or Harry Potter, I am happy that, for once, an author was realistic about what would happen to a traumatized sixteen year old girl in extraordinary circumstances who has survived way longer than probable.\", 'overall': 4.0, 'summary': 'What did you expect?', 'unixReviewTime': 1382572800, 'reviewTime': '10 24, 2013'}\n"

No. There's an interval and then there's a second act, and then there's the end. So okay, this story has more than 2 acts. By the end it will have, maybe, 7. So it's not really fair to say 'these characters aren't important' or 'this was just a bridge' or 'we didn't get to the end' ...  because until we do reach the end, we can't tell.I believe Martin is the single greatest fantasy writer of our time. I think he will go down in history as one of the greatest, full stop. Was I frustrated at the long time between books 3 and 4? You'd better believe it. Am I sorry that some of my favourite characters didn't appear in Feast? Yes. I'm desperate to know what's happening with Tyrion. But that's what I get for not waiting till the completion of the series. I'm reading it in installments and not all my questions will be answered right away. One possible explanation for people's dissatisfaction is that this isn't a 'complete' novel the way books 1-3 are ... it is a single entity split in two. Is that a fault? Perhaps, but I'm not upset by it.Martin has spent 30 years honing his craft and perfecting his narrative skills, and I believe we as readers are reaping the benefits. I loved this book, and I eagerly look forward to the next part of the story. This is a saga of unequalled breadth and passion, with characters who live, for me, more powerfully than any other in fiction at the moment.Bravo, Mr Martin.

Her strange sensitivity to light, and seeming ability to communicate with the family dog, are secondary concerns to the kids at her middle school who tease her for having an absent father. Despite gaining herself the nickname \"freaky Fern,\" she leads a generally happy life, thanks to her mother\\'s caring and her twinbrother Sam\\'s friendship.But one day in the middle of English, Fern simply disappears. No one can find her; no one has seen her leave the room, much less her desk. Unbeknownst to her classmates, Fern has somehow managed to teleport to Pirate Cove, her favorite part of a nearby beach. Frightened and unsure of how she got there, Fern tries to tell the truth, but her mother isn\\'t believing it and neither is the school\\'s headmaster. The next time she vanishes and reappears, it is to a much more dangerous location, and by then it\\'s impossible for Fern to keep her activities under wraps. It\\'s only after a series of dangerous accidents that Fern discovers the truth of her identity and the full extent of her powers as an \"otherworldly,\" the politically correct term for any creature that is not entirely human.Kogler does a wonderful job of detailing the average twelve-year-old\\'s insecurities and the way that they are magnified in Fern, who is anything but average. She presents a compelling picture of what it\\'s like to grow up different in a world where schoolchildren are cruel and ostracize people who don\\'t fit in. I found Fern, Sam, and their mother to all be very sympathetic and believable characters, whose motivations were easy to accept.I also enjoyed Kogler\\'s conception of the titular \"otherworldlies,\" which made this book refreshingly different from other vampire stories I have read. Her use of Greek myths as the starting point for a number of inhuman creatures and supernatural powers put a new spin on the traditional vampire myths.Overall, THE OTHERWORLDLIES was a satisfying read, with a plot that asked more questions than it answered but still managed to come to some kind of conclusion. Kogler\\'s left herself open for a sequel, perhaps even an entire series, about Fern\\'s future, and I for one look forward to whatever she comes up with next.Reviewed by:  Candace Cunard', 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': 'Courtesy of Teens Read Too', 'unixReviewTime': 1213920000, 'reviewTime': '06 20, 2008'}\n",

Ertle \"The Truth is Out There\"', 'helpful': [75, 101], 'reviewText': 'Well, I always thought that Good to Great was too good to be true. The author and his team picked several firms that exploded in the late 1980s compared with some selected \\'matched\\' firms that did not do well and tried to identify a set of criteria that they could identify to attribute cause to the effect (success). The problem is that with such retrospective analysis (this would be called a case-control study in clinical research) you can only identify differences and can never attribute cause and effect. These types of studies are inherently poorly resistant to biases inserted by the authors. Typically, they have a preconcieved notion of what they are looking for and then go find it in a self-fulfilling prophesy. This book is no different. The data is from public and published information like SEC reports, other published info, and interviews. The data is pretty subjective.I was wondering what happened to some of the \"great\" companies compared to the ones that were not great in the same industry (in clinical research, you would always pick two to four comparitor cases, rather than just one, to prevent bias, or to help prevent it). The reason to look was based on my glance at chart on page 2 where it was clear that the \"great\" companies were beginning to level off. Now we all know that there was a huge stock boom in the mid- to late- 1990s and that emotion and luck played as much a part in many success stories and were short lived. The book was published in 2001. What happened to those companies?So here is what I found (the first company is the \"great\" one):Walgreens traded at ~$40 in 2001 and about ~$46 now. Eckerd was purchased by J.C. Penny in 1999 while they were researching the book. Seems to be a crappy comparitor.Abbott traded at ~$46 in 2001 and about ~$42 now. Pharmacia was purchased by Pfizer in 2000 while the book was being written. Seems to be a crappy comparitor.Circuit City traded at ~$9 in 2001 and about ~$18 now. Silo went bankrupt in 1995. Seems to be a crappy comparitor.Kimberly-Clark traded at ~$65 in 2001 and about ~$60 now. Kimberly-Clark bought Scott Paper in 1995. Seems to be a crappy comparitor.Gillette traded at ~$34 in 2001 and about ~$55 now. Pfizer purchased Warner-Lambert in 2000 as the book was being written. Seems to be a crappy comparitor.Wells Fargo traded at ~$44 in 2001 and about ~$62 now. Bank of America traded at ~$20 in 2001 and about ~$45 now.Kroger traded at ~$24 in 2001 and about ~$19 now. A & P (Great A & P Tea) traded at ~$7 in 2001 and about ~$28 now.Thus, it seems that the attribution of cause and effect to the differences they found was a completely flawed methodology and probably has more complex solutions and reasons. It also shows that the authors had tremendous selection bias and compared the \"great\" firms with primarily those firms know to be doomed. Not a fair comparison. The ones that didn\\'t cease to exist seem to be doing as well to day as their \"great\" comparitors.Additionally, most of the concepts are recycled. Not bad ideas, but recycled with different jargon attributed to older ideas. The idea that leaders and managers should focus on what the firm and they do best, what they are passionate about, and what they can achieve rather than what they want to achieve is a great idea, but not new and it sure didn\\'t need to be called the hedgehog concept.', 'overall': 1.0, 'summary': 'Great until the Bubble Broke', 'unixReviewTime': 1132012800, 'reviewTime': '11 15, 2005'}\n"

Surprise!The story is told in alternating chapters: one chapter in \"the present\", where Lily (known as Lee) is working as lawyer for a conman accused of murdering one of his marks; and then one in \"the past\", that tells Lee\\'s life story, from her parents\\' marriage, her subsequent birth, up until close to the time of the present-day story. Forth and back it goes.From the get-go, there are intimations of where the conman story is going, and really it\\'s just a matter of how it plays out.

The pickup truck was instantly left without a driver and the pages that follow had her fighting for her life in a crumpled truck at the bottom of a hill.Yet, there were too many storylines of monotony. In an effort to establish the new world that these kids exist in, there are dozens of instances of children who are wandering the streets, not knowing how to cook themselves food, not knowing how to deal with crisis' and such.

I will start with the cover which by the way is beautiful and goes perfectly with the storyline. This book was beautifully written and the story had me crying and thinking that this is something that could happen to any one of us.Laurel is a junior in high school and full of life. She is a straight \"A\" student and has everything going for her. One night she and her family are on their way to their neighbor\\'s house and after dinner they decide to all go out to get some ice cream. Laurel doesn\\'t want to go and asks to go home instead. That was the last time she would see her mom, dad and little brother alive. Mr. Kaufman was the only one that survived but is now in a coma. David, Mr. and Mrs. Kaufman\\'s son had also decided not to go with them that night and just like Laurel, lived. Luckily for Laurel, her grandmother came to stay with her and took care of her, but poor David had lost his mom in the crash and his dad was in the hospital on life support and no one to help him with this tragedy. Now Laurel has to try to move on with her life and try to accept that her family is gone. The only problem is that it\\'s pretty hard when you are surrounded by things that trigger memories of the people she loved the most. Laurel keeps all her thoughts and emotions to herself and doesn\\'t let anyone know what\\'s she\\'s thinking, not even her best friend Meg. But for some reason, the only person she feels close to and comfortable with is David.This story is filled with emotions. I will admit that I cried and laughed at times. I loved Laurel and felt every emotion she went through. It must be horrible to lose your family like that. Jennifer Castle wrote an amazing story that captured my heart.

I chose this book because I was curious to see if it was anything like Wuthering Heights (a book I rather enjoyed) writen by the other Bronte sister.Jane Eyre is a conflicted love story. It follows the life of, surprisingly, a woman named Jane. She lives a harsh childhood, first in the hands of an unloving aunt and her abusive son and then later in the confines of the deteriorating Lowood school. She resides at the school for 8 years and realizes that she wants to experience more of the world outside of the Lowood school. Jane then works as a nanny at a place called Thornfield where she falls in love with her master, Mr. Rochester.This love story is complicated and conflicted in that the love between Mr. Rochester and Jane is forbidden on more than one level.Jane Eyre was much more than I had expected. Although I enjoyed Wuthering Heights, I found Jane Eyre to be much more engaging. At many times, while reading this novel, I found myself completely frustrated yet intrigued and eager to continue at the same time. Bronte evokes such emotion in this novel, from the harsh realities of Jane's childhood to the whirlwind romance between her and her master. I found Mr. Rochester's courtship of Jane to be the most entertaining. I found Jane's confusion and reluctance to be frustrating, yet thought-provoking. And I found the separation of the two to be vexing and upsetting. Ironically, I found the ending to be strange, yet fitting in a story of constant ups and downs. It was an overall great read!\", 'overall': 4.0, 'summary': 'Jane Eyre', 'unixReviewTime': 1124409600, 'reviewTime': '08 19, 2005'}\n",

And what a shadowy and unseemly world it is: hired researchers devoid of ideological basis save the almighty dollar, sources with questionable motives, and in general people willing to stop at nothing to dredge up \"the truth\" on opposing candidates.  What results is a vast wonderland of mirrors: what is the truth, how do well \"sell\" candidates, how do you reveal \"the truth\" about your opponent in the most unflattering way?  \"We\\'re With Nobobdy\" is replete with numerous examples of the lengths to which opposition researchers will go to dig up dirt, the unsavory characters they utilize to get that dirt, and the people who serve that dirt up.  Meanwhile voters claim to express distaste for the dirt served up, yet lap it up with a voraciousness that would make Caligula blush.  \"We\\'re With Nobody\" is a scathing indictment and exposure of opposition research, but ultimately an expose without an end goal.

The first sentence of the book, \"life is difficult,\" reflects Scott Peck\\'s idea that spiritual/mental growth must be worked towards, that human beings are generally lazy, and that growth of consciousness is a life-long process. Everything is generally working against our growth: laziness; defense mechanisms employed to maintain the status quo of mental illness over the struggle for accepting responsibility; confusion over the true nature of love; resistance to \"grace\"  (the idea of being open to our unconscious and the symbolic language of God); lack of discipline; adults being mentally and spiritually immature; poor parenting resulting in nuerosis and character disorder; and a culture that generally defends, accepts, and nurtures sickness over health.Sometimes Scott Peck\\'s language is a little heavy, but it\\'s only because he packs so much valuable information and insight into each page. The first chapter on Discipline (a tool to solve our problems. Another great Peck idea: see problems as challenges, and it is in our response to problems that life takes on its meaning and color) was a bit dry to me, but contains excellent information on delaying gratification, balancing and bracketing (attempting to listen to others/view situations with objectivity), dedication to the truth, and a key to anyone seeking to grow: ACCEPTING RESPONSIBILITY.The second section on Love was fascinating to me. Scott Peck does a great job debunking the myth of romantic love, but perhaps most valuable is the idea that real loving is about nurturing your own or another\\'s spiritual growth. Love is an action and a decision, not just a feeling. It\\'s so easy in our culture to imagine love as a feeling, red roses, wine, dinners, etc. That is the illusion of romance but has nothing to do with the work and courage of real active loving (Scott Peck says if an action doesn\\'t involve courage or work, it\\'s not loving!). Also in this chapter are a few controversial ideas, namely open marriage (Scott Peck\\'s extension of the idea that loving involves encouraging an individual\\'s total development...hmmm...sort of vague extension to me to involve plural relationships. what happened to discipline?) and even Scott Peck\\'s suggestion that he would have sex with a patient if he felt it would further both their spiritual development! (do not agree with this at all. any person in treatment is not in a position to navigate such power dynamics)The final section on Grace reminds us to look to our unconscious for information and guidance. Dreams, nagging thoughts, sudden insights, etc. from our unconscious, which Scott Peck says knows more than our conscious ever could, are signs that there is a God, and he/she/it is a loving God interested in our spiritual development (reflection of Scott Peck\\'s idea of love, and a good idea if you ask me). These signs are meant to prod us into action.In general, although at times you will be re-reading pages to make sure you got the meaning, and sometimes Scott Peck\\'s language will seem heavy and plodding, this book will help you see where you can expand the boundaries of your spirit, your mind, and your life, how you can love bigger and better (and make it mean more to everyone), how your life can have meaning and consistency, and how to be a loving, conscious person, parent, lover, mate, and friend. I underlined a LOT in this book, and going back to read just my underlines I am amazed at the amount of loving, valuable insight in this book. Growing and truly accepting responsibility for the quality of our lives is not as easy as it sounds. Scott Peck is very aware of this and gives a lot of support to keep on journeying this road less traveled.', 'overall': 4.0, 'summary': 'worth the effort', 'unixReviewTime': 1046822400, 'reviewTime': '03 5, 2003'}\n"

In a \"success\" scenario, if corn at harvesting time cost 50 cents less per unit of transaction (say, per 5000 bushels) than its cost at planting time, and the difference between contract prices (for the same amount of crop) sold and bought at planting and harvesting times, respectively, was also 50 cents, then the farmer would have made a successful hedge.There are many things one needs to know in order to become a successful commodity futures and option contract trader.  This book provides a good grounding in: knowing what a futures and an option contract is and how they\\'re different, how trading such instruments are different from, say, trading stocks, pros and cons of futures and option contract trading compared to stock trading, what goes into contract specifications, quotes, and profit and loss calculations for different commodities (e.g., delivery / expiration dates, what a trading unit represents [e.g., 1 contract of corn futures = 5000 bushels], how price movements are quoted [e.g., in cents or dollars], dollar value of each price unit movement [e.g., a penny change in corn futures contract price = $50], etc.)Adding commodities to one\\'s investment portfolio is usually thought of as a diversification strategy / opportunity.  Direct trading of commodity futures and option contracts, which in my opinion requires considerably more skills and knowledge than buying and selling mutual funds or stocks, however, is not the only way to get exposure to commodities investment or trading opportunities. Other avenues include buying and selling commodities-related mutual or exchange traded funds, or stocks of, say, commodity producing companies such as mining companies.  I\\'m not sure why the author focused on futures and option contract trading heavily in a book meant for helping beginners get started with commodities, but in my opinion, including a discussion of those other avenues would have added value to this beginners\\' book.Other types of information missing from, but could add value to, this book include:  discussion of the potential usefulness of trading simulators that help beginners get a feel for futures and option contract trading using virtual rather than real money and a sampling of the companies that provide such educational opportunities; references to other useful books or resources such as commodity-specific trade association web sites; or perhaps even a sampling of companies that provide futures and option contract trading services in addition to the author\\'s company, DeCarley Trading.An introductory book that covers more than Commodity Futures and Option Contract Trading as well as the other types of information I\\'ve mentioned above as missing from this book is Scott Frush\\'s Commodities Demystified.  Published in 2008, it\\'s a more engaging and easier read than this book but small parts of it may no longer be up to date (for example, the Top 25 Commodity Mutual Funds listing may no longer be valid); however, the concepts discussion is still valid and quite good.', 'overall': 4.0, 'summary': 'Narrowly focused on Futures and Option Contract Trading', 'unixReviewTime': 1268438400, 'reviewTime': '03 13, 2010'}\n"

With regards to their analysis of the biblical period, I was very impressed  at their genuine concern with true history rather than just relying on  scripture to provide the details. When dealing with each period, they  refrained from giving painstaking details and rather delivered a good  overview. Those wishing to satisfy their curiosity for details are able to  consult the bibliography for further reading.In Part 2, the Jewish  literature for each period is reviewed including the origin of the Torah  and an overview of Rabbinic literature such as the Talmud and  beyond.Parts 3 and 4 deal with the theory of Judaism and Jewish  practices. These are excellent for those who are being introduced to  Judaism for the very first time, or for those who could do with some  revision or brushing up on some of the important rituals, laws and  festivals.Overall, I must say this book is informative and a pleasure to  read and remains an excellent reference book.', 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': 'Comprehensive account of Jewish History and Religion', 'unixReviewTime': 962582400, 'reviewTime': '07 3, 2000'}\n",

A memoir by Ariel Dorfman, the novelist, the exile, living now with his family in Durham, North Carolina, where he holds the Walter Hines Page chair at Duke University.  To a certain extent I did like it, but the author comes over as a smarmy  busy-bee who pokes his nose into everything and inevitably gets himself  into trouble.  He sounds like a nave adolescent, full of himself, pathetic  despite his experiences and accomplishments.  He is an idealist, a quirky  character, a good writer, no doubt an eccentric.What is most incredible  is that the man now lives in the USA despite all his criticism of the  country's influence on the Third World in such books as How to Read Donald  Duck.  A bonus point for the USA for letting him stay, I'd say.  This is  not to say that Dorfman is incorrect in his assumptions though, rather it  begs the question of why did he choose to live in the US?  No doubt, it is  where he is most likely to draw attention to himself, have his books  published, and hold a secure position!  In that he's not much different to  the rest of us at heart, only differing insofar as his writing and exile is  concerned.Heading South, Looking North is an account of Dorfman's  early years in the US, his life in Chile, his involvement during the  Allende years, his struggle with language, namely American English and  Latin American Spanish, and finally his exile from Chile where this book  ends.The chapters alternate between his early years and the Allende  years, before he brings it all together in the closing chapter.  The  writing is often in the present tense and meanders and grinds on and on,  thereby it is easy to lose a grasp of what's being said.  Nonetheless, I  quite liked the style, though much of the time I couldn't see what the fuss  of whether to use Spanish or English was about.  Well, so it's difficult to  be fluent and think and write in both languages.  This is a writer's  dilemma, his agony so to speak, but it's no big deal.  That is unless you  want to make it one, and Dorfman does.  Whatever, he seems to succeed in  his efforts to write in both languages.I feel he uses that theme here  as an overburdened vehicle to the Allende years and his involvement in the  revolution.  A guy like this is bound to be involved in some sort of  revolution or other.  And in this book his supposed squeaky clean honesty  reminds me of modern day politicians, who I do not trust.  I'd be watching  my back if Dorfman was around for sure, he protests too much and I feel  there is definitely something he is not saying although he is supposed to  be saying it all.I look forward to reading a novel by him though.\", 'overall': 3.0, 'summary': 'Mixed feelings', 'unixReviewTime': 937526400, 'reviewTime': '09 17, 1999'}\n"

She knows how to lay out a complicated story on several levels at one time, satisfying both the historian in all of us and also the child who likes to hear a romantic tale.  The book is beautifully done and I\\'m not surprised it has been an international bestseller.  Has it altered our appreciation of the famous movie with Gable and Laughton?  I think not.  All of the versions I\\'ve seen (including the one with Mel Gibson and the notorious Brando one) have some merit, and the story of conflict is one that keeps repeating itself over and over like a nightmare of civilization.  Caroline Alexander sees it as a class fable, in which poor old William Bligh may have whipped a few men here and there, but no worse than the way he was treated as a boy and young man.So continues the cycle of abuse, lo, even unto the next generation.  All in all, a tiptop read.', 'overall': 4.0, 'summary': 'Peter Heywood not so bad as Alexander says', 'unixReviewTime': 1108512000, 'reviewTime': '02 16, 2005'}\n"

I have read every single one of his books, bar none.  Bar none, this was poorest book he has ever written.  The settings, characters, and story line are classic -- you can pick almost everyone of them out of his previous WW II era novels.  It has a lot of plot similarities to Eye of the Needle and Jackdaws.However, the overall plot is extremely predictable.  You can see just what is going to happen after reading the first 25%.  The details however revolve time and time and time again on a  whole series of coincidences which is very out of character for Follett.  I liked most of his books because the story line follows a logical flow with interesting bobs and weaves stemming from an initial premise.  This was more like a low budget movie where things happen by coincidences and characters survive by inches or seconds so many times it becomes unbelievable and ridiculous.The climatic seen of the flight to England has to be the absolutely worst piece of writing ever by Follett.  The events are ridiculous, the characters repeatedly make stupid errors, and the whole thing plays like a cheap B movie.  For instance, are we to believe that the only character who knows how to fly the plane falls asleep during a night flight over water half an hour after almost being shot out of the sky -- and the inexperienced person that's awake lets her sleep?  Or the king of them all, are we to believe the character waits till the airplane is within minutes of running out of gas before remembering to add the extra can of gas he has in the cockpit -- which he could have done 4 hours earlier?  Or how about delaying a day the flight that will change the war and save thousands of lives so that the main character can go to the ballet?  Or how about the German guard helping push the plane out for takeoff because he can't put two and two together?  He must not be related to the other character that can throw a cigar into the cockpit of a small airplane at takeoff speed.Come on Mr. Follett, you can do better.

I wanted to read the words that a depraved sociopath would find interesting. This well read killer was documented to have also been seen reading Melville while imprisoned.  His hanging ended an era of killings, of maybe upwards of 200 people or more. He was well known to have dissected, and incinerate many of the victims, so the true number was never known.

There are paragraph- to page-sized entries on a wide variety of subjects, listed in alphabetical order.  If you\\'re looking for a good cover-to-cover read on Norse mythology, I highly recommend H. R. Ellis Davidson\\'s \"Gods and Myths of Northern Europe\".I own three of these dictionary-style books on Norse mythology, probably THE three such books: Lindow (this book), Rudolf Simek\\'s \"Dictionary of Northern Mythology\" and Andy Orchard\\'s \"Dictionary of Norse Myth & Legend\" (or whatever the current publisher\\'s calling it these days).Of the three, Lindow is by far the most accessible and user-friendly to the layperson.  There\\'s a wealth of information here, and it\\'s written and presented very well and with a healthy amount of humor (one doesn\\'t often see the poem \"Thrymskvida\" described as featuring \"Thor in drag\").That said, it\\'s also true that this book doesn\\'t contain the hoard of detailed, otherwise obscure information that Simek and Orchard have to offer.  On more than one occasion I went to look up something in Lindow and was surprised that it wasn\\'t there.  For example, I find it odd that there\\'s an entry for Ratatosk (a squirrel that inhabits the world tree Yggdrasil, a relatively minor character), but not one for, say, Svartalfaheim (in some accounts, one of the Nine Worlds of Norse mythology, realm of the \"black elfs\", or dwarfs).The bottom line is, if you have a casual interest in Norse mythology and want a well-written, simple reference, then Lindow\\'s your man.  If you want practically everything there is to know about Norse mythology that\\'s available in English, well, Simek or Orchard are probably your best bet.But even if you\\'re going whole hog and decide to get Simek or Orchard, get Lindow too, if for no other reason than that he\\'s an absolute blast to read.', 'overall': 4.0, 'summary': 'Excellent as a jumping-off point', 'unixReviewTime': 1185667200, 'reviewTime': '07 29, 2007'}\n",

In this book, we find out exactly how this happened.It is not a spoiler to say that Viscount Linford married his wife when she was just 16 and married only for her money (promised him by her miserly and misanthropic father), since this appears in the first chapter. We soon learn that he was a rather dissolute rake, but has changed his ways. Linford visits his aunt in London and is introduced to her entrancing friend, Mrs Emily Stowen, who is apparently a widow of means. However, it turns out that Mrs Stowen is neither a widow nor all that unknown to him. If you have read a few romances, you will guess her identity even before the hero does.The rest of the story is taken up with the attempts of Lord Linford to win back his wife through means fair and foul, and how Lady Linford finds her place as chatelaine of a great country estate, despite the machinations of a rather nasty neighbor. There is a sub-plot involving attempted rape and murder, and blackmail, although most of the story is focused around the growing friendship between Linford and his wife.My main problem with the story is that I found a couple of secondary characters - a young neighbor Lucy Maitland (and her family dynamics), and a retired Bow Street runner - far more interesting than the hero and heroine. When this happens, even a decent story loses its attraction. However, this might not happen to you.Anne Ashley writes a competent Regency romance, with nothing really jarring.

Hotchner, that revealed to the world upon its publication in 1966 that Ernest Hemingway died in 1961 not of an accident while cleaning a gun but of an intentional self-inflicted gunshot. If that was all this book had to offer the world on Hemingway, it would not still be in print.  He provides an up close and personal portrait of a man he admired and called a good friend, but a complicated personage all the same.  This is not a critical, exhaustively researched biography weighing 10 pounds; it is memoir by someone who experienced life with the man firsthand, an account that comes across with honesty and enough detail for readers to draw their own critical conclusions.Hotchner was a young writer dispatched by a magazine in 1948 to find the by then world famous Hemingway in Cuba and negotiate an article.  Hotchner's terror at the assignment turned into high surprise as Hemingway took to him and brought him right into his inner circle.  Hotchner never talks about himself really, so we don't know what Hemingway saw in him, but it had to be something because Hemingway was not a man who trusted easily, who required exacting standards in his pals, who also included restaurateur Toots Shor, Marlene Dietrich, Gary Cooper and Ava Gardner.  Hemingway was at the top of his powers in 1948, living as he thought life should be lived and settled in with his fourth and last wife, Mary, who could stand up to him.  On the pretense of editing work, he takes Hotchner along for European adventures, making fun while also disclosing memories of his earlier days, and most important, what inspired his classic novels.  As they move into the 1950's together, Hotchner also catches evidence of Hemingway's battle with mortality.  He has a tough road back to health after surviving a plane crash in Africa, and then, trying to work again, he is bowled over by the response to THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA (the Pulitzer) and the Nobel Prize. Castro, with whom he thought he had an understanding, takes his home and sanctuary.  He is briefly revived in the outdoors of Ketchum, Idaho, but depression and paranoia begin to tear at him.  What now seems a brutal electric shock treatment at the Mayo Clinic, especially for a man who never believed in analysis or being penned up, who wanted to do his own fighting, preceded his death.\", 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': 'Defeat not an option', 'unixReviewTime': 1188259200, 'reviewTime': '08 28, 2007'}\n",

The first-person narrative is such a bold move because it immediately gives a sense of autobiography that a lesser writer would have come across as merely self-indulgent. Yet, he invents an academic figure to \"write\" the foreword - Jakob Haarhuis, a fictional professor of Japanese at NYU, provides an explanation for how the memoirs are gathered, that they are the taped memoirs of the protagonist Sayuri.While it\\'s obvious that Golden has done his research, what takes the book to a higher level is the way he penetrates the psyche of the people caught within the orbit of this cloistered world. The story follows the life of Chiyo, a nine-year old Japanese girl who is sold into slavery along with her older sister Satsu. Because of her unusual grey eyes, Chiyo is then sold to an okiya (boardinghouse for geishas). The scenes in the okiya are Golden\\'s most meticulous and accomplished, especially as Chiyo undergoes a grueling apprenticeship and competes with the beautiful, worldly but wholly spiteful Hatsumomo, who is the okiya\\'s star geisha. Men become bewitched by her poise and subservient manner, and she takes her new name, Sayuri, symbolizing her metamorphosis into a professional geisha. Surviving some unsavory escapades with some of the okiya\\'s most undesirable patrons, Sayuri surpasses Hatsumomo in stature and becomes the mistress of the man she had set her heart on all along, the benevolent chairman of an electrical supply company.While a more predictable story would have stopped there with the love story, the author goes further and has Sayuri move to New York to run a salon for visiting Japanese businessmen until the chairman dies. In a certain way, I wish Golden did stop the book in Japan when WWII ends in the story. The chapters afterward feel rushed as if the author is losing interest in her story and wants the reader to get to the inevitable ending quickly. Regardless, Golden fills the book with vivid images and subtle descriptions of the nuances of Japanese culture. Absolutely invaluable in its detail if sometimes too overwhelming to appreciate at once (a repeated reading is recommended), the story reflects a brilliant eye for the customs and rituals within geisha society, including its politics, rivalries, and traditions. Having been to the historic Gion district of Kyoto, where present-day geishas still live, I have caught a glimpse of these women scurrying about in their beautiful kimonos looking both fetching and anachronistic. Golden captures their stories with compassion and an anthropologist\\'s fervor. This is strongly recommended both as fiction and an essential ingredient of Japan\\'s cultural history.', 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': \"Behind the White Mask Lie Further Layers of Subverted Identity in Golden's Sharply Observed Novel\", 'unixReviewTime': 1131753600, 'reviewTime': '11 12, 2005'}\n",

This nonfiction book describes the origin of the first effective in vitro cell line (HeLa cells) from a poor black woman.

The side stories tell about life in the rural south as tobacco farmers, scraping to make ends meet by putting the entire family to work; life in the slums of Philadelphia plagued by child abuse, drugs, and violence; and the challenges for many poorly educated citizens to understand modern medicine, technology, and economics.In short, \"The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks\" is a compelling book about the interface of science and society, written for the general public but a wonderful \"read\" for both nonscientists and scientists alike.

Obviously hard to find unless one uses Protestant books. I purchased this book, but immediately felt disappointed. I am an at-home, homeschooling, very traditional Catholic woman, and some of the reflections rubbed me the wrong way, or were hard to relate to, because they were so contemporary and did not seem universal enough to apply to my life. They also struck me less as meditations and more as anecdotes. However, after awhile, the book began having an unexpected effect on me which, while different than I expected, was positive nonetheless. While I could not relate to some of the anecdotes or reflections, I did find myself learning more and more about how to apply scripture to my life, beyond the obvious ways the Church has always taught. It was as if, by relating the experiences and thoughts of other women, the book was giving me permission to insert my own story, my own sufferings and struggles and joys, into salvation history. So, while I do not find myself meditating on the given reflections in the way I expected, they DO inspire meditation! A second positive effect is, I find myself obsessively reading scripture out of curiosity as to what the next reflection will be! Three words of caution: First, while some reflections are only a page or two apart, occasionally there are many pages between daily reflections. In that case, one must make a choice of reading many pages, or skip large sections of the Bible to keep pace with the sequence of reflections. Second, there are a few reflections which are questionable in terms of theological accuracy. One example describes Christ\\'s birth as involving pain, blood, and an umbilical cord, which sounds to me like a denial of the Virgin Birth. Another cautions us against allowing our religious rituals to come between us and another person; this can be read in an acceptably orthodox way as advising us not to be too rigid, but could also be read as permission to skip Mass in the name of charity. Third, I am personally not fond of the inclusive-language translation of the NRSV. I realize it is approved by the Church, but sometimes in the awkward effort to use inclusive language, the meaning is diluted or completely altered. For example, sometimes the word \"man\" is used not simply to refer generically to any human being, but is meant to refer to Adam, either literally or figuratively. Therefore, changing it to \"person\" or \"humankind\" loses some of the intended meaning. As does the use of \"students\" in place of \"brothers\"; clearly those words are not synonymous. Thankfully, there are footnotes indicating the original words whenever these alterations are used. But these alterations seem unnecessary; I don\\'t know of any woman who has ever been offended by the original language of the Bible, which was, after all, authored by God. Overall, a worthwhile book. I would like to see a somewhat different version for women, perhaps drawing more heavily upon women saints than contemporary authors, and with reflections which are more truly meditative than anecdotal,using a non-incusive-language text.', 'overall': 4.0, 'summary': 'Grew To Like This Book', 'unixReviewTime': 1167350400, 'reviewTime': '12 29, 2006'}\n",

If you have ever listened to Governor Romney speak, this book reads like a long speech. It is readily comprehensible, plainly spoken, and frequently well versed.It is so named because Obama\\'s apology tours, denigrating America, are well known, and heinous for any American elected or appointed official to do, much less for the President of America. Obama should apologize for apologizing, and the best way for America to ensure he does that is to support great folks like Mitt Romney.Sometimes this book is not well versed.He addresses many problems facing America today. Overall he addresses them well, with some disagreements, some ignorance, some shortchanging, and some omissions.He names Russia, China, and Islamofascism as the three main foreign policy threats we face, plus he includes the somewhat minor actors such as Chavez in Venuesuela, Kim in North Korea, etc.His call for ensuring that Iran does not acquire nuclear weapons is stirring, but not stirring enough. His call for an anti-missile defense system is good, but not good enough. His warning of the threat of an Electro Magnetic Attack (EMP) on the US is brief; it is over in one mild paragraph. He does not really tie these three together as he should have. He does not really elaborate on what Iran and the rest of the world could/would do if Iran does become a nuclear power.He does not mention that we need a perfect anti-missile defense system to deter an EMP attack, for which we would only have 30 seconds warning from launch to detonation, and that is not enough time to react except automatically. Three missiles launched from three container ships off of our coasts could successfully send most of the USA back to the stone age with only 30 seconds warning, and Iran could mount such an attack.He does not cover, as Newt Gingrich does, as Mike Huckabee does, and the Heritage Foundation does, and as the Clarion Foundation does, how a successful EMP attack on the USA would be a civilization killer. He says we would be without electricity, but he doesn\\'t say that it would last for two or three years, and that over 90% of all Americans would die in the first year due to starvation, disease, and violence as civilization totally collapsed. I recommend \"One Second After\" by Newt Gingrich\\'s frequent co-author, William Forstchen, which, in novelization form as no attack has yet happened, is an accurate representation of the danger such an attack would be.Romney does not elaborate on how to keep Iran from accquiring nuclear weapons, what we shoud do besides toothless sanctions, or what to do if Iran does acquire nuclear weapons, which the Obama administration will allow Iran to do (i.e. will do nothing to deter or stop them).He covers all bases regarding Climate Change, coming down, sort of, on the side of adapting to climate change, rather than implementing a job killing tax increasing ponzi scheme like cap and trade. However, one has to question whether this is a subject the Governor really studied, for if he had, he would know that climate change is entirely natural; that CO2 is not the causative factor in climate change, and that man is not the cause either. As the East Anglia E-mails state, there has been 15 years of global cooling - is that also caused by CO2? It is a shame that the Governor really didn\\'t do his homework on this subject.Governor Romney has read \"America Alone\", by Mark Steyn, which covers the demographics that are going to turn most of the rest of the world\\'s countries into Islamist countries well before the end of this century. He has called it a powerful book, and has recommended that all members of his staff read it. The operative question is whether or whether not the USA can survive as the last Western Civilization country on this Earth.Governor Romney does not address how to keep the Chechen Muslims, like those who took over the Belsan school and slaughtered over 100 kids, from taking over Russia. What kind of threat will an Islamist Russia with all of their nuclear capablilities be? He doesn\\'t address the Threat from all of Western Europe becoming an Islamist continent, including nuclear armed France, overrun by the Muslim Brotherhood (who tried to blow up the twin towers in 1993), and what kind of threat that will be to America\\'s security. He doesn\\'t address the Threat of nuclear armed England, when the Deobondi sect of Islam (the Pakistan version of the Wahhabi sect that all 19 of the 9/11 killers adhered to) takes over England. He doesn\\'t address the threat of Islamist Canada being overrun by Wahhabism and becoming a springboard for invading the USA by these Islamists around the world. He doesn\\'t address the threat of large sections of Central and South America becoming Islamist countries. He doesn\\'t address the threat of Islam to the continued existence fo the USA as a non-Islamist country, and that becoming an Islamist country is a very, very bad event for our progeny. If we do lose this global war, as we are headed towards, and become an Islamist country, nothing, else, absolutely nothing else we are discussing today will matter.Governor Romney needs to spend some quality time with the U.S. House of Representatives Anti-Terrorism Caucus, chaired by Rep Sue Myrick (R-NC).As something needed to do to strengthen America, which he believes in firmly, fortunately, strengthening the traditional family, the real family, is a key part of his strategy and this book. His discussion of the actions needed is more thoruogh and detailed than even his economic analysis. This part of his book should be studied and his recommendations taken to heart by every American Politician of all political parties.Governor Romney has said on his book tour interview that this book is not about social values, and I accept his explanation.Overall, this is a worthwhile book, with many good recommendations. The flaws, and ignorance the Governor displays on some subjects, including the omissions, make this book deserving of a follow up book to properly address them.Governor Romney could have perfected this book without much more effort, and it\\'s a shame that he didn\\'t take the time to do it right in the first place.', 'overall': 3.0, 'summary': 'No apology is an apt title, but apologies are needed for omissions', 'unixReviewTime': 1268179200, 'reviewTime': '03 10, 2010'}\n",

Farrar\\'s beauty, fiery temper, and numerous flirtations become part of the plot in which a visiting French baritone who has antagonized everyone uses a throat spray laced with ammonia. His vocal chords, indeed his voice, are permanently damaged. \"He might as well be dead,\" intones Farrar, and soon her words come true. With herself as a major suspect, Farrar, urged on by Enrico Caruso, initiates her own investigation, which turns out to be a delightful romp.Surrounding Farrar are stars who were a major part of her life during the Mets \"golden age.\" The author has created wonderful fictional sketches of Caruso, Pucinni, Emmy Destinn, Pasquale Amato, Toscanini, and actor David Belasco. Even Farrar\\'s young female fans, the famous \"gerryflappers,\" are given a part to play. The short Epilogue tells you what happened to these personalities in the following years.A more serious leitmotif is the constant references to the looming European war. Most of the singers are from lands increasingly drawn into the conflict. Memories of good times there are recalled amid the growing realization that that the war might last, that America may be drawn into it, and that the inevitable war relief tours will become standard fare. These tense moments are lighten by descriptions of the singers hangouts, the Met and Belasco theaters, Mulberry Street on the Italian immigrant Lower East Side, and, above all, the numerous backstage dramas.', 'overall': 3.0, 'summary': 'United States - New York, 1915', 'unixReviewTime': 1247616000, 'reviewTime': '07 15, 2009'}\n",

My sister loves books and being intrigued by beautiful cover art is how she chooses the books she is going to read, and it seems to work for her every time. I decided to try it this time with HALO.The summary on the inside sleeve of the book is decent enough to make you wanna read, and the first few chapters are quite easy to read through. There were times at the start of reading HALO that I was reading 5 chapters a day. I was impressed that Miss Adornetto was only 18-years-old when HALO was released. Her writing style was mature and descriptive. I was jealous at how easily writing seemed to come to her, when I\\'m older than her and struggle nearly every day to get my story ideas down on paper.However, getting past the angels settling in to their new environment, my opinion about HALO quickly went downhill. At first it was easy to look past Bethany\\'s naive in-take on everything, as this was her first time on earth and being human. But you\\'d think living in Heaven, watching humans live every day life from above would have given her a brain. I mean, you\\'d think instinctively she\\'d know right from wrong, but it was so easy for her to fall right into the role of being a teenager. Vanity and Xavier were the only things that mattered to her.There\\'s one part in HALO where Bethany attends her first teenaged house party, a party in which her beloved Xavier saves her from, and actually gets drunk off some alcohol because her brother Gabriel told her that humans have to keep hydrated.After the party Bethany starts to see Xavier more, sneaking out of the house one night to see him. It seems so easy for her to disobey her siblings and lose sight of their original reason for being on earth in the first place. She\\'s totally caught up in Xavier, thinking about him, talking about him, doing everything with him. It even gets to the point of not being able to exist without him. Xavier starts to annoy when he becomes overprotective of Bethany, insisting that she eat and drink regularly. As one reviewer said: he even plays airplane with her to get her to eat a power bar.Then, one day at school after talking to her girl friends, Bethany is influenced to bring up sex with Xavier, asking him if he\\'d ever thought about doing it with her and if he and his dead girlfriend Emily had a \"physical relationship\" too. This particular scene bothered me the most. Actually, Bethany brought up Emily a lot, wondering if she was as good as Emily.I found Bethany to be very weak and lacking a lot of faith. She often whined to Xavier, questioning his love for her and crying over the moment she\\'d have to return to Heaven, never to see or be with Xavier again. There\\'s one part that reminded me a lot of Bella from New Moon, just after Edward breaks up with her, where she\\'s depressed because she can\\'t live without her \"other half.\"Then there\\'s the new mysterious kid in school, Jake Thorne, who immediately gave me the impression he was bad news. Adornetto gave no mystery to this guy, describing him in dark clothing, long black hair and high cheek bones. Slowly but surely the goth students started to hang around him. There was no surprise when the rugby match came around and a dark figure stood across the field just before Xavier Woods took a fall and broke his leg and got a minor concussion. I knew right away it was Jake Thorne. Bethany acknowledged the figure but didn\\'t take much concern to it. You would think being an angel sent to earth to get rid of dark forces she could have sensed more from a dark force, which brings me to...Gabriel. When Jake attends the prom with Bethany due to the fact that Xavier had a concussion, he threatens her. Xavier says he can take Jake down but Gabriel insists that Jake is of dark forces, that no one knows exactly what he is or what he is capable of, that they need to find out first. He repeats this often, yet I never felt he put much effort into figuring out what exactly Jake was.Overall, I was disappointed in this book. I read it in a week and can\\'t believe I wasted my time. Luckily I only requested it free from the library. I wanted so badly to like this book, as the cover was amazing; I wanted to be able to have it on my book shelf. Apparently the picking-a-book-by-its-cover method doesn\\'t work for me as it does for my sister.HALO actually makes me feel angry every time I talk about it. The angels are weak; Bethany is too obsessive, too whine-y and too naive. Castiel from the TV show Supernatural isn\\'t as ridiculously stupid as these angels are. I do not recommend this book... unless you\\'re a huge fan of the Twilight saga and just want a story exactly the same, but instead of vampires and werewolves you get angels and demons.', 'overall': 1.0, 'summary': 'A beautiful cover with a fallen plotline', 'unixReviewTime': 1310083200, 'reviewTime': '07 8, 2011'}\n",

When I was about halfway finished, I ordered the hardcover copy, and the second book in the series -- it was just that good. I finally finished Kushiel\\'s Dart tonight, and felt inclined to write about it.This is not your typical fantasy. While there definitely are fantastic elements, there is no superhuman sorcery, no elves and goblins. Most of the fantasy in the book is reimagined history -- and that part is superbly done. It takes place in a Europe (Europa) of probably the 1000\\'s, with France (Terre d\\'Ange) being the most sophisticated country, more Renaissance-like than medieval. Much of the rest of the world, however, is delightfully primitive. Christianity is not dominate -- in fact, only a few Jew-like Christians are around in this world, although it is generally accepted by the French (D\\'Angelines) that there was a Jesus. England (Alba, which is definitely a well-researched name) is Pictish, and Germany is inhabited by barbarian Norsemen. The names for everything are perfect -- Hellas (Hellenism is the age of Alexander the Great) for Greece, Tiberium for Rome, Aragonia (think Ferdinand of Aragon) for Spain. It feels like she put a lot of thought into designing her world.The plot, too, is excellent. The main character is not your typical fantasy \"chick\" -- she doesn\\'t fight, magically or physically, and some things about her are almost repulsive. Pricked by Kushiel\\'s Dart, she feels pain as sexual pleasure -- and, thus, becomes very useful as a bed-partner to those with sadistic tastes. Still, I liked her quite a bit, and found her a very believable heroine. She saves her homeland -- through the use of her sexual skills, her beauty, and her wits.Plenty of people have criticized this book for being \"porn\". It really isn\\'t pornographic at all. There are vivid sex scenes, but they aren\\'t disgusting or pornographic. I wouldn\\'t recommend this book to a 12-year-old fantasy fan, but I wouldn\\'t warn anyone away from it due to the explicitness of the sex scenes.And the writing! The writing was just beautiful. Poetic, surpassing even the beauty of Tolkien. The heroine lives in a land of beauty and elegance, where every D\\'Angeline is descended from angels, and has their beauty. It follows that the language would be beautiful as well.An excellent book. Ten stars out of ten.

I was quietly made aware of their real mission and being young, naive and wanting to \"take it to the enemy\" thought it was a good idea. I was in command when COL R. made his inspection tour sometime in the Spring of 1969. I think 1LT Martin was off site but COL R. seemed to already know about his operation. LTC B, my immediate boss did not know about it and I had to fill him in on what little I knew. LTC B quickly understood and did not ask anymore questions. About the time I was preparing to leave for the States 1LT Martin was wrapping up his operation with a lot of haste. I had no idea what had happened until I returned to the States and heard about it on the news. Little did I know how close I was to such a historical event.

Like any of us, they are faced with the reality of their situations and grow to overcome many (but not all) of their flaws.Weeks writes with a very visual style, giving your imagination plenty, but not too much, information to go on. Cities are painted to reflect their hidden nature, castle halls come to life through the action, and forests seem to have their own storyline. It can be hard to put the series down once you've picked it up.Why four stars then? A matter of personal taste. Weeks delves into some deep psychological areas of his characters, and doesn't shy away from some dark matters. Rape, Cannibalism, Torture are all included, and in some ways normalized. He's also liberally uses profanity. All of it fits within the world and characters he's created -- very little of it was jilted outside of the story. If those things don't bother you inside of a good story, then you'll deeply enjoy the Night Angel series. If you can overlook them in the context of the story, you'll find a deep world that will have you thinking about the characters after you've closed the cover. It left me wondering if Weeks could accomplish the same thing in the lines of Sanderson or Jordan without going into the nitty gritty of the darker side, and instead letting it merely exist with his characters.Nonetheless, a well written series, and with that caveat, worth the read!\", 'overall': 4.0, 'summary': 'Great series, but...', 'unixReviewTime': 1339286400, 'reviewTime': '06 10, 2012'}\n",

Now I personally have the balance and coordination of a drunken ostrich on a good day, so dancing isn't exactly my forte. But I love and respect the elegance of dance, both choreographed and improv. I admire the dedication people have to this sport; they constantly and consciously inflict damage and pain on their body to achieve that perfect move, that perfect moment. I found myself just as captivated by Sophie Flack's Bunheads as surely as if I were watching a live ballet.Watching dancers on stage or in a movie was one thing, but I wasn't sure about how I would enjoy reading about them. I often find that when a book revolves around a specific sport or hobby that isn't as well known, it can be somewhat offsetting to the reader. We don't understand the technical jargon that the writer casually tosses about, but I felt Flack handled herself wonderfully. If I didn't completely understand a move or maneuver, the rest of the description in the page was more times than not enough compensation. And while the novel does focus heavily on dance, it's so much more than that.Hannah struggles as a dancer translate easily to life. She's making decisions now as a young adult that will not only shape her career, but her life. After devoting her life to dance, Hannah starts to yearn for something more. While she still loves dance, she starts to realize she's missing the little things in life that we non-dancers take for granted regularly. When she meets Jacob she starts to really notice all those little things and that adds up into one big question: Can she have both ballet and a life of her own?With Flack's background as a dancer, this novel could have easily slid into the category of preachy and confusing. There is no doubt that Flack knows her stuff when it comes to ballet, but there's a fine line between knowing and writing. I must say that Flack danced that thin line with the finesse one would expect of a ballet dancer. This book is graceful, fast, and intoxicating to watch unfold.\", 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': 'The Irish Banana Review', 'unixReviewTime': 1324944000, 'reviewTime': '12 27, 2011'}\n",

Brown is a delightful read--one especially suited for those taking Web programming courses or wanting to learn the inside strategies on Web site design/programming preparation.The book starts off by covering the fundamentals of wireframes, personas, site maps, concept models, and flowcharts.  These components of the book are not only technical in a how-to format, but also practical in a business sense.  In fact, Dan Brown makes a point of stressing how to negotiate these \"deliverables\" in business meetings, in essence preparing the reader for a career in design strategies.The second part of the book not only emphasizes how to format the products (i.e., wireframes, personas, etc) into professional deliverables through providing structure for the reports, but also delves into competitive reviews, usability plans, and usability reports.  Of most interest to me was the competitive review, as it helped establish the framework (including site map) of a site I\\'m about to build.  One easily overlooked shortcoming of the book is that it doesn\\'t spend the time on research strategies, such as focus groups and interviews that the book A Project Guide To UX Design by Russ Unger does.  However, Communicating Design exceeds many other books in its elaboration on the personas, wireframes, site maps, flow carts, etc.--the actual deliverables.Although the book doesn\\'t delve into how to create the deliverables in different software programs (it only mentions a few of the usable programs like Illustrator and Microsoft Visio, for instance), one can go to Lynda.com for a month-to-month membership and access tutorials on these components.  Communicating Design shows, instead, how to create the different deliverables, how to conduct oneself in business presentations of the deliverables, and how to format them into impressive reports.It is also important to note that Dan Brown\\'s second edition felt more cumbersome at first, due to its wide size, but after spending time with the interior of the book, the read was quite pleasant.  The pages were glossed with lots of white space and friendly diagrams.Dan Brown\\'s book proved essential in helping me prepare for the initial design set-up of a Website, and I would argue that the steps he provides in his book are almost indispensable to making an excellent site.

It was a shock.  I assumed that everyone experienced music the same way.  Wrong!Do you ever ask anyone what happens when they hear music?  I didn't before I read this book.  Now I plan to ask everyone.Dr. Sacks has the kind of fine writing style and awareness of music that makes his tales seem as appealing as the cases that Dr. Sigmund Freud wrote about.  As Dr. Sacks pointed out, Dr. Freud didn't care for music so that gentleman failed to investigate and report on many of the phenomena in this book.We don't exactly know why the mind and body interact with music in the ways that they do.  Part is undoubtedly heredity.  Part is undoubtedly due to exposure to musical influences.  Some may relate to the language spoken in the home.  Difficulties with seeing may also be an influence.  Injuries to the body and brain can play a large role.  Dr. Sacks does a masterly job of using case after case to explore one aspect or another of these dimensions so that a complex picture emerges that's even more remarkable than the brain processes involved in reading.One of the biggest surprises in the book is that musical talent seems to be inhibited by some parts of the brain.  In similar way, music can also inhibit some other brain functions that we would like to get rid of.I had always wondered about those with perfect pitch, and the book explores that.  There are also wonderful sections on other seemingly inherited musical abilities.Dr. Sacks adds a lot of perspective to the history of music by making observations about various composers and the way that their compositions reflect certain musical abilities than others while explaining how the mental processes are different. Today, we can map the brain's activation in order to get clues about why certain behaviors are possible.  That final perspective adds a lot to the case histories.If you are like me, you'll find some of the cases to be heart-wrenching.  I was comforted a bit to realize that music made those sad lives better so there's reason to rejoice in that sense.So what was my big personal discovery?  When I listen to classical music of any kind, I can choreograph a ballet along with costumes, sets, and props to go along with the music that I see in color when I close my eyes . . . even if the music has never been used for ballet.

You can flip the book open to any page and pull out something worth reading aloud and for that alone, I'd take my hat off to the man.  But beneath the distracting beauty of the prose is a very familiar story.  A good man returned from a bad war in a small town with a dark side, in this case, Sicilian gangsters, including the worst of the worst, a one eyed knifeman.  Sound familiar?  It is.  Gatreaux is at his best when he's wrapped in descriptions of the little lumber town called Nimbus, but the characters who populate it are prone to portentuous talk and symbolic actions.  We have riffs on Greek myths, serpents in beds, man mountains engaged in knife fights in rivers, but I found little to persuade me from the thought that Gatreaux was bluffing with a weak hand.  Namely, that at the center of the novel, lie a pair of brothers that he doesn't seem to have a handle on.  The war veteran has apparently killed scores of men, so that he is accustomed to doling out death in close quarters, yet over 95% of men in World War One were killed through shelling or machine guns, both distant intervention.  It was this, the blindness of fate, that you couldn't see who you were killing, or who was killing you, that was responsible for much of the pressure described as shell shock.  Gatreaux's veteran comes across then as a mythic figure, but the author seems to want us to believe in the grit and truth of his town.  I found it ultimately impossible, when I couldn't believe in the grit and truth of his characters, leaving the book with a hollow beauty, disappointing despite the promise.\", 'overall': 3.0, 'summary': \"Writing can't disguise the weakness of the plot\", 'unixReviewTime': 1064880000, 'reviewTime': '09 30, 2003'}\n",

Ever human's IQ soars to 400 or something like that.This book suffers from the problem a lot of sci fi books have - the author isn't really able to conceive of what people that smart would think or do, or invent because - well - the author isn't that smart; so aside from characters being able to conceive of new differential equations on the fly (some people can already do that, I'd bet) and invent new languages there isn't much happening here.The funny part is everybody with a boring job (that is to say, everybody except the scientists) simply quit working so there is no food or anything to buy.

The action centers on Jim and Frank, young colonists on Mars, and Jim's 'pet', Willis.  Mars is run by the Company who supplies the colonists needs, including a boarding school for high school aged colonists and organizing the annual migration.  As Jim and Frank (and Willis) arrive at school they discover that not everyone working for the Company has the colonists best interests at heart.  The kind head master is replaced by an autocratic bully who promptly confiscates all guns and pets - including Willis.  While rescuing Willis the boys uncover a more serious plot and soon the three are fleeing across the planet to warn their families.This book is very much a precursor to STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND, the descriptions of the Martians, their culture, and abilities are very much the same.  The basic story is one of RAH's typical youngster(s) same their society with the help of friendly aliens, very much in the same vein as, PODKAYNE, HAVE SPACESUIT WILL TRAVEL, THE STAR BEAST etc.  As always with RAH's stories it is exciting, has more than a few interesting twists and will probably cause the reader to re-examine some long held beliefs.  It also has some more annoying RAH traits - the women are definitely there to feed the men and raise the children, the characters are all either completely good or completely bad.  RAH's familiar themes of 'arms make the citizen', 'big government is bad government', 'the aliens will save us' and 'women need to be protected by men' are also all there as well.This is a fun read, for both adults and children.

Yes, I do expect a book purporting to teach me historical facts to get basic grammar and usage correct.-In the introduction, she tells of Elizabeth translating a work she calls \\'Mirror or Glass of a Sinful Soul,\\' and on the next page for some reason she tells much the same story and refers to the work as \\'Mirror of a Sinful Soul.\\'  Such redundancy and sloppiness would have caused me to get a paper returned with a failing grade on it when I was a freshman in college.Oooh, but it\\'s fun!

An ambitious young woman reporter for The World newspaper in New York suddenly thought she could possibly beat that record in real life, alone.  She studied timetables and planned before approaching her boss and talking him into the journey.  She would set out by ship from Hoboken, NJ and finish there in less than 80 days.News of her race against time spread quickly.  It inspired the editor of Cosmopolitan (which was a totally different publication pre-Helen Gurley Brown) to send one of his columnists in the opposite direction in hopes of beating the World reporter.So Nelly Bly, reporter extraordinaire, and Elizabeth Bisland, beautiful, sophisticated literary type set out on their race.  Nelly Bly was a pseudonym taken from a popular song of the day.  She didn't know about Bisland's attempt until they practically crossed paths in the Far East.This is a long book of nearly 400 pages but my interest in it never flagged.  One ad I saw compared Goodman's handling of the story to Erik Larson and I agree.  There are pictures of the people and places and modes of transport to help the reader feel part of the exciting trip.  Complications abounded for both women as weather, miscommunications, and mechanical problems with ships and steamers conspired to slow them down.One funny part of Nelly Bly's story is that she was suddenly approached by several young men, one at a time, who seemed eager to marry her.  Rumor had it that she was an heiress who was traveling to mend a broken heart.  Her sudden suitors were looking for someone wealthy to support them, and at least one didn't mind saying so.  Finally she told one young man that it was all an act; actually she was quite poor and a friend had paid for her trip.  That was the end of the suitors.I won't ruin the story by telling you who won the race but even afterward the story of the two women and the rest of their life is fascinating.  In retrospect, I suppose I could have predicted their fate, but then again maybe not.Highly recommended readingSource:  Amazon Vine\", 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': 'Women Attempt to Outdo Phileas Fogg in 1890s', 'unixReviewTime': 1359676800, 'reviewTime': '02 1, 2013'}\n",

You very rarely see that in romances, and I really appreciate it. There\\'s no reason not to have a blind hero in a romance novel. I loved Vincent as a character. He seemed real to me...he was a man who had accepted his disability with dignity, yet, was still at odd times overwhelmed by panic attacks in relation to it. His emotions ran the gamut, and I liked that. I also liked Sophia...to a point. She just seemed a bit too one-dimensional to me. Her only \"flaw,\" if you could call it that, was that she was not necessarily beautiful. But, the author seemed to solve that with new clothes and a hair cut. Besides her Aunt, Uncle and cousin, everyone else loved her, even if they initially thought she was unattractive on first meeting her, that opinion changed rapidly, and they ended up loving her. Even the \"evil\" cousin she had that ruined her self-esteem came off as an idiot that really didn\\'t dislike her. She never had a bad word to say about anyone....she was just a bit too \"goody-goody\" for me. I need to see that she\\'s got some flaw, or she just doesn\\'t seem real.The story overall was good, and I did like the way that Sophia came up with all of these ideas to help Vincent out on his estate. But, again, Sophia has all the ideas. Everyone else seems to be clueless. Another way that the Sophia character is too perfect. All that perfectness made for a bland story. There was really no conflict at all. There was some potential conflict that could have happened between Sophia and Martin, Vincent\\'s valet. But it just seemed like Martin disliked Sophia, then went away from the story for awhile, then came back and loved Sophia like everyone else did. So much for conflict. I really need some kind of \"spice\" to my stories. This one really had none.

But for the most part, I enjoyed it. Of course, this isn't a story about the first blush of love or the first stirrings of passion. Laren and Alex have been married for about five years. They were wonderfully in love when they exchanged their vows, but the crushing loss of a baby three years ago drove a wedge between them that they have not been able to overcome.The book opens with the MacKinloch clan under attack. Their homes are burned to the ground and Laren is injured. Despite her wounds, she doesn't turn to her husband. And it's his fear of her death coupled with the realization of her distance that wakes Alex up to the serious chasm between them. He vows to fix things, but watching the two of them try to reconcile is frustrating and sad. Alex is the chief of the tribe and he expects Laren to be the lady of his people. But she is terribly shy and her childhood as a poor outcast makes her feel unable and unworthy to be what her husband wants her to be. Instead, she finds her solace in glassmaking. It's a skill she learned from an old priest after her son's death. She finds beauty and purpose in her art and she has done it for years in secret.Laren's glass can generate the money they clan needs to rebuild. But Alex feels betrayed that she has kept this secret all these years. The two of them clearly love each other. However, it's difficult to watch them blunder through their relationship. Alex lords over Laren the same way he rules the clan. He tries to bend her to his will. Though admittedly, his intentions are good, he does real damage to her spirit and makes her feel that he doesn't value her for who she is. At the same time, Laren is guilty of being a martyr. She hides her feelings and keeps her secrets by telling herself Alex doesn't need to be burdened by them. I wanted to just shake them both, especially during the first half of the book.Things do get better, though, as our couple begins to understand and accept each other. And watching them finally come together is quite lovely. There is deep loss and sadness in their relationship, but there is real love there, which makes their journey worth watching... especially once they begin to communicate.An external threat does hover over our couple, in the form of the clan's enemy... who is trying to crush the MacKinlochs once and for all. Also, we've got some strong secondary characters, like Alex's brothers, which give the book more depth. I'm really interested to read poor Callum's story --and I hope it comes next.Overall, I found that I did enjoy this, especially once our couple started actually talking to each other. 4 stars.*ARC Provided by NetGalley\", 'overall': 4.0, 'summary': 'Finding love again', 'unixReviewTime': 1310860800, 'reviewTime': '07 17, 2011'}\n"

I was interested to learn about his relationships with other illustrators and artists, his personality and family, and his own view of the art world and his place in it.  Although I grew up with Rockwell\\'s covers on the Saturday Evening Post that were delivered to my family\\'s home every week, before reading this book I knew little about him as a person.Solomon\\'s a good writer and the book is a quick, easy read.  She focuses more on the events of Rockwell\\'s life than on his art, although the art is not neglected.  She seems to be writing more for the general reader than the art academic.What I found strange was Solomon\\'s references to Rockwell\\'s sexual issues, not that he really had any, that we are told of, but she gives us little off-hand remarks about homoerotic issues, and say . . . was there a latent pedophile lurking inside Norman?  I could not figure out her purpose.  Did she feel she needed to juice the book up a bit - in many ways Rockwell was sort of boring, not your drunken womanizer type male artist who\\'s relatively easy to write about - was she trying to establish her own creds with the gender studies and queer theory crowd, or is she subconsciously driven by repressed gender identity issues of her own?  Interpret at your own risk (phrase borrowed from Solomon herself - below).As a illustration (yes) of Solomon\\'s bizarreness, after planting the homoerotic, homosexual and pedophile issues in your mind, she comes (yes, intentional, read on) to write about a mural Rockwell did for the Nassau Inn in Princeton, N.J., which included an image of Yankee Doodle.  The first line of the Yankee Doodle song was to be written on the mural.  Was it \"Yankee Doodle came to town,\" or Yankee Doodle went to town.\"  The \"debate\" was written up in the July 17, 1937, issue of The New Yorker magazine.In Solomon\\'s telling: \"Princeton\\'s board of trustees took a vote; it resulted in a tie.  Rockwell settled on the word \\'came\\'.  Interpret at your own risk.\"  \"Come\" on, Debbie.  Not only that, if one goes back, as I did, and reads the entire original piece in The New Yorker, it\\'s clear the word \"came\" was chosen, but it is not clear that it was Rockwell\\'s choice.  Go figure.My recommendation: read the book but forgive Solomon\\'s overly fertile mind and ignore the obvious absurdities.', 'overall': 4.0, 'summary': 'A good book, but a very strange one', 'unixReviewTime': 1392249600, 'reviewTime': '02 13, 2014'}\n",

In essay after essay, I found myself saying,\"Go on, Joan. You said it, Joan. We are the same, you and I, Joan, etc.\" That is the type of book Slouching Towards Bethlehem is. Reading it, slowly, meticulously, I felt such a close kinship, a bond, not with the writer but with her words -- so carefully chosen and wonderfully articulated. These essays are not meant, honestly, for teenagers, although, if given a chance, the totality of the book would be most beneficial for their pliable and socially indoctrinated minds.The purport of this book is something that I can so easily identify with: the disappearance of the past for the establishment of a fragmented, roughly organized new society with newfangled, unaccustomed societal perceptions as well as an aggressive casting off of the traditional value system of those who were born and raised a long time before the emergence of the radical, cataclysmic sixties. These essays explore, through author Joan Didion\\'s own feelings and experiences and the feelings and experiences of those she encountered, the disharmononized emotions of the hippy generation vs the elders of the more reactionary periods, periods where: Free Love, Acid Trips, Groovy, Crystal Snorting Gurus and Muumuu Dressed Followers seemed a complex and social oddity in the hierarchy of those who were deemed, \"Not with it, man.\"What is so nice about these essays is that they are not condescending; there were and are thousands upon thousands of citizens and non-citizens alike who had and have no clue whatsoever as to what the counter-culture represented (me, honestly, being one in that vast catagory). Joan Didion thrust herself into its epicenter, and with a keen eye took it all in, trying to understand. The darkness of the counter-culture I think is best represented in the title essay \"Slouching Towards Bethlehen\" on page 101:  \"Pretty little 16-year-old chick comes to the Haight to see what it\\'s all about & gets picked up by a 17-year-old street dealer who spends all day shooting her full of speed again & again, then feeds her 3,000 mikes & raffles off her temporarily unemployed body for the biggest Hight Street gangbang since the night before last. The politics and ethics of ecstasy...\"  That was the darkness of the counter-culture, but that is not representative of the entirety of it. Didion\\'s family can be traced back all the way to the Donner-Reed tragedy in which cannibalism was the well known result. Thus, California is liked to that sole dark act; it is forever historically and symbolically linked, California becoming tarnished and not the land of \"Golden opportunity.\" That is one way of looking at the counter-culture. Or it can be viewed in this fashion, in the essay: \"Rock of Ages\" about Alcatraz Island on page 208:\"I saw the shower room (in Alcatraz) with the soap still in the dishes. I picked up a yellowed program from an Easter service...and I struck a few notes on an upright piano with the ivory all rotted from the keys and I tried to imagine the prison as it had been, with the big lights playing over the windows all night long and the guards patrolling the gun galleries and the silverware clattering into a bag as it was checked in after meals, tried dutifully to summon up some distaste, some night terror of the doors locking and the boat pulling away. But the fact of it was that I liked it out there, a ruin devoid of human vanities, clean of human illusion, and empty place reclaimed by the weather where a woman plays an organ to stop the wind\\'s whining and an old man plays ball with a dog named Duke...\"Maybe that is what the hippy generation was trying to flee from: \"Human vanities. Human illusions.\"Slouching Towards Bethlehem is a book where the search for meaning is in of itself the comprehension of change.

And despite some of the negative reviews here (which almost dissauded me), I found this book one of Satrapi\\'s most magical, perfect creations.  It\\'s quite different than the autobiographical, child-like Persepolis I, though readers of Persepolis II and Embroideries will recognize the general tone and style.  That said, it\\'s a work that takes you by surprise with its directness, honesty, and sheer invention.The book follows the last eight days of Nasser Ali Khan\\'s life, as he decides to resign himself to death after his wife, in an argument, destroys his precious \"tar\"--an Iranian sitar-like instrument.  He is a master musician, renowned throughout the country, and the great love affair of his life (despite one thwarted human one) was with this reciprocating instrument.  Unable to find another tar to requite his passion, he loses all taste for life and its joys, and decides to stay in bed until Azrael, the Angel of Death, comes for his soul.  While waiting, we get a series of flashbacks and flashforwards as he--and others--recount the stories and anecdotes that frame his life.  Reading this book is like listening in on family stories around the dinner table, which by their very nature are fragmentary, interrputed, and from multiple points of view.Though a simple story, the manner of telling it is amazingly complex and mesmerizing.

It painted with a two-color palette and lacks balance, perspective, and truthful experience. Savvy teens will reject its complete lack of honesty and versimilitude. Do adults really think that teenagers are so naive, they can't discern propaganda from life? I mocked this book when I was 14 for its obvious fabrications.How will it impact kids' decisions to know that they are being fed untruths, 'for their own good'?

I am certainly glad I did.  This author has an amazing gift.  I enjoyed the book so much I found myself resenting any intrusion that would keep me from reading.  I adored the characters, both Christian and Maddy.  Maddy is a Quaker and although some may be troubled by the thee-thou language, I found it a charming affect of the heroine.  Her faith was such a large part of her life, yet she married a Duke in part to save him from the horror of a madhouse as he recovers from a stroke.  The desperation this man feels at being trapped in his own body as he struggles is palatable and frightening.  You don't have a heart at all if you are not irresistibly drawn in to the story.  The abuses in the madhouse can be disturbing but nevertheless in context with the story, they serve a purpose.  If you like all hearts and flowers brain candy type romance novels, this is not the book for you.  Yet, if you want a riveting story, unforgettable characters, and an intense hero that will steal your heart immediately, and a heroine that you wish you could embrace, Flowers from the Storm is the book for you.  Christian, although reared with all the haughty arrogance of a Duke, learns a gut wrenching humility as he copes with his affliction and his dependence on his Maddygirl slowly turns into an intense all consuming passion.
