      "You may laugh, but I have found that Otherland volumes 1-4 are poor at picking up debris around the house.  I once spilled some cornflakes on the floor, and foolishly thought that I could clean it up by dropping &#34;City of Golden Shadows&#34; on it.  Not only did it not clean, it managed to make things worse by fragmenting the cornflakes into smaller and smaller pieces.  I did what any normal person would do: I stacked the other books on top, hoping that the combined power would whisk the cornflakes away to the technological wonderland that is Otherland.  No such results.Bin Otherland Empty, on the other hand, works like magic.  If you hook it up to a powerful enough motor, you can banish those cornflakes to the land of wind and ghosts.  The downside is that it's pretty light reading, but given the young adult trend these days it's following the light reading trend that literature is headed for these days.It's recommended that you get through the previous volume though (&#34;Hoover Electrical Vaccum Unit&#34;).  I mean, Bin Otherland Empty does work as a stand-alone, but it's not quite as absorbing when not paired up with the prequel.  Some people think you can skip the previous volume and lust stick your mouth in at one end and suck, but, c'mon, that's just gross.Spoiler alert!  Cornflakes vaccumed up.\n",

I come to this topic from both a Christian background and intellectual skepticism. But in the past fifteen years I have been exposed to and come to see the value of several forms of oracle and divination as tools for tapping into the subconscious as well as whatever one chooses to believe about the unseen energies and spirits possibly involved. I have often experienced remarkable outcomes and guidance from Runes, I Ching, and various forms of Tarot Cards, and have come to trust and value my own gifts of intuition. It was exciting to see what I have experienced with \"divination\" and oracle tools so well summed up and explained.This is an attractively laid-out, beautifully illustrated book that is impressively distinct from many coffee-table type overview \"encyclopedias\" on various subjects for actually having something useful and insightful to say. So many of these type of books are rushed into print to take advantage of popular (and superficial) interest in a given subject and are mostly cheap eye candy with shallow content and often misinformation. What impressed me most about this book is the author\\'s knowledgeable and balanced presentation. He is not dismissive of religion, but he is forthright about how religion and mainstream culture have repressed alternative realities and methods throughout history. This book is not full of gushy New-Age-speak.

It is not Orwell or Huxley, so expecting the writing to fly off the page and create a vivid, disturbing world is completely unrealistic. That said, the writing was oftentimes slightly disappointing when compared with the other novels.Getting immersed in the novel is troublesome: it is halting and stuttering for the first half. Roth seems to have lost her rhythm and keeps throwing the exact same obstacle at her characters disguised as different problems (A rebellion here... a rebellion here... a rebellion here... a rebellion here... it is an interesting look into a country that's collapsing, but it becomes quite too predictable).As interesting as it was stylistically to switch chapters between Tris and Tobias's point of views, that creates a disjoint: there is none of the continuity of the first two books. Once you're immersed in Tris's narrative, her chapter ends, and suddenly you are forced to remove yourself from her brain and try to enter Tobias's head. Also, the style of voice for each character isn't quite differentiated enough to really allow this separation to fully take place. There were times when I would forget whose head I was in, and it was simply because the style did not change enough to move me from one to another.However, having finished the book, the conceit makes more sense. We had to have a look into Tobias's head.As for those who disparage Roth for ending it the way she did, I, too, was disappointed. Yet Tris always did things true to her character: things she had done in the first book and in the second. There was no other way for Roth to end the series and have Tris remain an authentic person. Sure, we all want a happy ending, but doing so would be a cop out. How likely would it be for a sixteen year old girl to survive all of the things Tris has survived? Not very. Add that to her self-sacrificing tendencies and what you get is exactly what Roth wrote. Was I angry? Yes. Heartbroken? Definitely? Did I spend the last eighty pages or so of the book crying, wiping my eyes, aware of what was going to happen? Yeah. But then again, I'm a writer, and as a writer, I would have been extremely frustrated if Roth had ended it happily for everyone. That's simply not realistic.So while I am sad that I didn't get the storybook ending a la The Hunger Games or Harry Potter, I am happy that, for once, an author was realistic about what would happen to a traumatized sixteen year old girl in extraordinary circumstances who has survived way longer than probable.\", 'overall': 4.0, 'summary': 'What did you expect?', 'unixReviewTime': 1382572800, 'reviewTime': '10 24, 2013'}\n"

No. There's an interval and then there's a second act, and then there's the end. So okay, this story has more than 2 acts. By the end it will have, maybe, 7. So it's not really fair to say 'these characters aren't important' or 'this was just a bridge' or 'we didn't get to the end' ...  because until we do reach the end, we can't tell.I believe Martin is the single greatest fantasy writer of our time. I think he will go down in history as one of the greatest, full stop. Was I frustrated at the long time between books 3 and 4? You'd better believe it. Am I sorry that some of my favourite characters didn't appear in Feast? Yes. I'm desperate to know what's happening with Tyrion. But that's what I get for not waiting till the completion of the series. I'm reading it in installments and not all my questions will be answered right away. One possible explanation for people's dissatisfaction is that this isn't a 'complete' novel the way books 1-3 are ... it is a single entity split in two. Is that a fault? Perhaps, but I'm not upset by it.Martin has spent 30 years honing his craft and perfecting his narrative skills, and I believe we as readers are reaping the benefits. I loved this book, and I eagerly look forward to the next part of the story. This is a saga of unequalled breadth and passion, with characters who live, for me, more powerfully than any other in fiction at the moment.Bravo, Mr Martin.

Her strange sensitivity to light, and seeming ability to communicate with the family dog, are secondary concerns to the kids at her middle school who tease her for having an absent father. Despite gaining herself the nickname \"freaky Fern,\" she leads a generally happy life, thanks to her mother\\'s caring and her twinbrother Sam\\'s friendship.But one day in the middle of English, Fern simply disappears. No one can find her; no one has seen her leave the room, much less her desk. Unbeknownst to her classmates, Fern has somehow managed to teleport to Pirate Cove, her favorite part of a nearby beach. Frightened and unsure of how she got there, Fern tries to tell the truth, but her mother isn\\'t believing it and neither is the school\\'s headmaster. The next time she vanishes and reappears, it is to a much more dangerous location, and by then it\\'s impossible for Fern to keep her activities under wraps. It\\'s only after a series of dangerous accidents that Fern discovers the truth of her identity and the full extent of her powers as an \"otherworldly,\" the politically correct term for any creature that is not entirely human.Kogler does a wonderful job of detailing the average twelve-year-old\\'s insecurities and the way that they are magnified in Fern, who is anything but average. She presents a compelling picture of what it\\'s like to grow up different in a world where schoolchildren are cruel and ostracize people who don\\'t fit in. I found Fern, Sam, and their mother to all be very sympathetic and believable characters, whose motivations were easy to accept.I also enjoyed Kogler\\'s conception of the titular \"otherworldlies,\" which made this book refreshingly different from other vampire stories I have read. Her use of Greek myths as the starting point for a number of inhuman creatures and supernatural powers put a new spin on the traditional vampire myths.Overall, THE OTHERWORLDLIES was a satisfying read, with a plot that asked more questions than it answered but still managed to come to some kind of conclusion. Kogler\\'s left herself open for a sequel, perhaps even an entire series, about Fern\\'s future, and I for one look forward to whatever she comes up with next.Reviewed by:  Candace Cunard', 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': 'Courtesy of Teens Read Too', 'unixReviewTime': 1213920000, 'reviewTime': '06 20, 2008'}\n",

Ertle \"The Truth is Out There\"', 'helpful': [75, 101], 'reviewText': 'Well, I always thought that Good to Great was too good to be true. The author and his team picked several firms that exploded in the late 1980s compared with some selected \\'matched\\' firms that did not do well and tried to identify a set of criteria that they could identify to attribute cause to the effect (success). The problem is that with such retrospective analysis (this would be called a case-control study in clinical research) you can only identify differences and can never attribute cause and effect. These types of studies are inherently poorly resistant to biases inserted by the authors. Typically, they have a preconcieved notion of what they are looking for and then go find it in a self-fulfilling prophesy. This book is no different. The data is from public and published information like SEC reports, other published info, and interviews. The data is pretty subjective.I was wondering what happened to some of the \"great\" companies compared to the ones that were not great in the same industry (in clinical research, you would always pick two to four comparitor cases, rather than just one, to prevent bias, or to help prevent it). The reason to look was based on my glance at chart on page 2 where it was clear that the \"great\" companies were beginning to level off. Now we all know that there was a huge stock boom in the mid- to late- 1990s and that emotion and luck played as much a part in many success stories and were short lived. The book was published in 2001. What happened to those companies?So here is what I found (the first company is the \"great\" one):Walgreens traded at ~$40 in 2001 and about ~$46 now. Eckerd was purchased by J.C. Penny in 1999 while they were researching the book. Seems to be a crappy comparitor.Abbott traded at ~$46 in 2001 and about ~$42 now. Pharmacia was purchased by Pfizer in 2000 while the book was being written. Seems to be a crappy comparitor.Circuit City traded at ~$9 in 2001 and about ~$18 now. Silo went bankrupt in 1995. Seems to be a crappy comparitor.Kimberly-Clark traded at ~$65 in 2001 and about ~$60 now. Kimberly-Clark bought Scott Paper in 1995. Seems to be a crappy comparitor.Gillette traded at ~$34 in 2001 and about ~$55 now. Pfizer purchased Warner-Lambert in 2000 as the book was being written. Seems to be a crappy comparitor.Wells Fargo traded at ~$44 in 2001 and about ~$62 now. Bank of America traded at ~$20 in 2001 and about ~$45 now.Kroger traded at ~$24 in 2001 and about ~$19 now. A & P (Great A & P Tea) traded at ~$7 in 2001 and about ~$28 now.Thus, it seems that the attribution of cause and effect to the differences they found was a completely flawed methodology and probably has more complex solutions and reasons. It also shows that the authors had tremendous selection bias and compared the \"great\" firms with primarily those firms know to be doomed. Not a fair comparison. The ones that didn\\'t cease to exist seem to be doing as well to day as their \"great\" comparitors.Additionally, most of the concepts are recycled. Not bad ideas, but recycled with different jargon attributed to older ideas. The idea that leaders and managers should focus on what the firm and they do best, what they are passionate about, and what they can achieve rather than what they want to achieve is a great idea, but not new and it sure didn\\'t need to be called the hedgehog concept.', 'overall': 1.0, 'summary': 'Great until the Bubble Broke', 'unixReviewTime': 1132012800, 'reviewTime': '11 15, 2005'}\n"

Surprise!The story is told in alternating chapters: one chapter in \"the present\", where Lily (known as Lee) is working as lawyer for a conman accused of murdering one of his marks; and then one in \"the past\", that tells Lee\\'s life story, from her parents\\' marriage, her subsequent birth, up until close to the time of the present-day story. Forth and back it goes.From the get-go, there are intimations of where the conman story is going, and really it\\'s just a matter of how it plays out.

The pickup truck was instantly left without a driver and the pages that follow had her fighting for her life in a crumpled truck at the bottom of a hill.Yet, there were too many storylines of monotony. In an effort to establish the new world that these kids exist in, there are dozens of instances of children who are wandering the streets, not knowing how to cook themselves food, not knowing how to deal with crisis' and such.

I will start with the cover which by the way is beautiful and goes perfectly with the storyline. This book was beautifully written and the story had me crying and thinking that this is something that could happen to any one of us.Laurel is a junior in high school and full of life. She is a straight \"A\" student and has everything going for her. One night she and her family are on their way to their neighbor\\'s house and after dinner they decide to all go out to get some ice cream. Laurel doesn\\'t want to go and asks to go home instead. That was the last time she would see her mom, dad and little brother alive. Mr. Kaufman was the only one that survived but is now in a coma. David, Mr. and Mrs. Kaufman\\'s son had also decided not to go with them that night and just like Laurel, lived. Luckily for Laurel, her grandmother came to stay with her and took care of her, but poor David had lost his mom in the crash and his dad was in the hospital on life support and no one to help him with this tragedy. Now Laurel has to try to move on with her life and try to accept that her family is gone. The only problem is that it\\'s pretty hard when you are surrounded by things that trigger memories of the people she loved the most. Laurel keeps all her thoughts and emotions to herself and doesn\\'t let anyone know what\\'s she\\'s thinking, not even her best friend Meg. But for some reason, the only person she feels close to and comfortable with is David.This story is filled with emotions. I will admit that I cried and laughed at times. I loved Laurel and felt every emotion she went through. It must be horrible to lose your family like that. Jennifer Castle wrote an amazing story that captured my heart.

I chose this book because I was curious to see if it was anything like Wuthering Heights (a book I rather enjoyed) writen by the other Bronte sister.Jane Eyre is a conflicted love story. It follows the life of, surprisingly, a woman named Jane. She lives a harsh childhood, first in the hands of an unloving aunt and her abusive son and then later in the confines of the deteriorating Lowood school. She resides at the school for 8 years and realizes that she wants to experience more of the world outside of the Lowood school. Jane then works as a nanny at a place called Thornfield where she falls in love with her master, Mr. Rochester.This love story is complicated and conflicted in that the love between Mr. Rochester and Jane is forbidden on more than one level.Jane Eyre was much more than I had expected. Although I enjoyed Wuthering Heights, I found Jane Eyre to be much more engaging. At many times, while reading this novel, I found myself completely frustrated yet intrigued and eager to continue at the same time. Bronte evokes such emotion in this novel, from the harsh realities of Jane's childhood to the whirlwind romance between her and her master. I found Mr. Rochester's courtship of Jane to be the most entertaining. I found Jane's confusion and reluctance to be frustrating, yet thought-provoking. And I found the separation of the two to be vexing and upsetting. Ironically, I found the ending to be strange, yet fitting in a story of constant ups and downs. It was an overall great read!\", 'overall': 4.0, 'summary': 'Jane Eyre', 'unixReviewTime': 1124409600, 'reviewTime': '08 19, 2005'}\n",

And what a shadowy and unseemly world it is: hired researchers devoid of ideological basis save the almighty dollar, sources with questionable motives, and in general people willing to stop at nothing to dredge up \"the truth\" on opposing candidates.  What results is a vast wonderland of mirrors: what is the truth, how do well \"sell\" candidates, how do you reveal \"the truth\" about your opponent in the most unflattering way?  \"We\\'re With Nobobdy\" is replete with numerous examples of the lengths to which opposition researchers will go to dig up dirt, the unsavory characters they utilize to get that dirt, and the people who serve that dirt up.  Meanwhile voters claim to express distaste for the dirt served up, yet lap it up with a voraciousness that would make Caligula blush.  \"We\\'re With Nobody\" is a scathing indictment and exposure of opposition research, but ultimately an expose without an end goal.

The first sentence of the book, \"life is difficult,\" reflects Scott Peck\\'s idea that spiritual/mental growth must be worked towards, that human beings are generally lazy, and that growth of consciousness is a life-long process. Everything is generally working against our growth: laziness; defense mechanisms employed to maintain the status quo of mental illness over the struggle for accepting responsibility; confusion over the true nature of love; resistance to \"grace\"  (the idea of being open to our unconscious and the symbolic language of God); lack of discipline; adults being mentally and spiritually immature; poor parenting resulting in nuerosis and character disorder; and a culture that generally defends, accepts, and nurtures sickness over health.Sometimes Scott Peck\\'s language is a little heavy, but it\\'s only because he packs so much valuable information and insight into each page. The first chapter on Discipline (a tool to solve our problems. Another great Peck idea: see problems as challenges, and it is in our response to problems that life takes on its meaning and color) was a bit dry to me, but contains excellent information on delaying gratification, balancing and bracketing (attempting to listen to others/view situations with objectivity), dedication to the truth, and a key to anyone seeking to grow: ACCEPTING RESPONSIBILITY.The second section on Love was fascinating to me. Scott Peck does a great job debunking the myth of romantic love, but perhaps most valuable is the idea that real loving is about nurturing your own or another\\'s spiritual growth. Love is an action and a decision, not just a feeling. It\\'s so easy in our culture to imagine love as a feeling, red roses, wine, dinners, etc. That is the illusion of romance but has nothing to do with the work and courage of real active loving (Scott Peck says if an action doesn\\'t involve courage or work, it\\'s not loving!). Also in this chapter are a few controversial ideas, namely open marriage (Scott Peck\\'s extension of the idea that loving involves encouraging an individual\\'s total development...hmmm...sort of vague extension to me to involve plural relationships. what happened to discipline?) and even Scott Peck\\'s suggestion that he would have sex with a patient if he felt it would further both their spiritual development! (do not agree with this at all. any person in treatment is not in a position to navigate such power dynamics)The final section on Grace reminds us to look to our unconscious for information and guidance. Dreams, nagging thoughts, sudden insights, etc. from our unconscious, which Scott Peck says knows more than our conscious ever could, are signs that there is a God, and he/she/it is a loving God interested in our spiritual development (reflection of Scott Peck\\'s idea of love, and a good idea if you ask me). These signs are meant to prod us into action.In general, although at times you will be re-reading pages to make sure you got the meaning, and sometimes Scott Peck\\'s language will seem heavy and plodding, this book will help you see where you can expand the boundaries of your spirit, your mind, and your life, how you can love bigger and better (and make it mean more to everyone), how your life can have meaning and consistency, and how to be a loving, conscious person, parent, lover, mate, and friend. I underlined a LOT in this book, and going back to read just my underlines I am amazed at the amount of loving, valuable insight in this book. Growing and truly accepting responsibility for the quality of our lives is not as easy as it sounds. Scott Peck is very aware of this and gives a lot of support to keep on journeying this road less traveled.', 'overall': 4.0, 'summary': 'worth the effort', 'unixReviewTime': 1046822400, 'reviewTime': '03 5, 2003'}\n"

In a \"success\" scenario, if corn at harvesting time cost 50 cents less per unit of transaction (say, per 5000 bushels) than its cost at planting time, and the difference between contract prices (for the same amount of crop) sold and bought at planting and harvesting times, respectively, was also 50 cents, then the farmer would have made a successful hedge.There are many things one needs to know in order to become a successful commodity futures and option contract trader.  This book provides a good grounding in: knowing what a futures and an option contract is and how they\\'re different, how trading such instruments are different from, say, trading stocks, pros and cons of futures and option contract trading compared to stock trading, what goes into contract specifications, quotes, and profit and loss calculations for different commodities (e.g., delivery / expiration dates, what a trading unit represents [e.g., 1 contract of corn futures = 5000 bushels], how price movements are quoted [e.g., in cents or dollars], dollar value of each price unit movement [e.g., a penny change in corn futures contract price = $50], etc.)Adding commodities to one\\'s investment portfolio is usually thought of as a diversification strategy / opportunity.  Direct trading of commodity futures and option contracts, which in my opinion requires considerably more skills and knowledge than buying and selling mutual funds or stocks, however, is not the only way to get exposure to commodities investment or trading opportunities. Other avenues include buying and selling commodities-related mutual or exchange traded funds, or stocks of, say, commodity producing companies such as mining companies.  I\\'m not sure why the author focused on futures and option contract trading heavily in a book meant for helping beginners get started with commodities, but in my opinion, including a discussion of those other avenues would have added value to this beginners\\' book.Other types of information missing from, but could add value to, this book include:  discussion of the potential usefulness of trading simulators that help beginners get a feel for futures and option contract trading using virtual rather than real money and a sampling of the companies that provide such educational opportunities; references to other useful books or resources such as commodity-specific trade association web sites; or perhaps even a sampling of companies that provide futures and option contract trading services in addition to the author\\'s company, DeCarley Trading.An introductory book that covers more than Commodity Futures and Option Contract Trading as well as the other types of information I\\'ve mentioned above as missing from this book is Scott Frush\\'s Commodities Demystified.  Published in 2008, it\\'s a more engaging and easier read than this book but small parts of it may no longer be up to date (for example, the Top 25 Commodity Mutual Funds listing may no longer be valid); however, the concepts discussion is still valid and quite good.', 'overall': 4.0, 'summary': 'Narrowly focused on Futures and Option Contract Trading', 'unixReviewTime': 1268438400, 'reviewTime': '03 13, 2010'}\n"

With regards to their analysis of the biblical period, I was very impressed  at their genuine concern with true history rather than just relying on  scripture to provide the details. When dealing with each period, they  refrained from giving painstaking details and rather delivered a good  overview. Those wishing to satisfy their curiosity for details are able to  consult the bibliography for further reading.In Part 2, the Jewish  literature for each period is reviewed including the origin of the Torah  and an overview of Rabbinic literature such as the Talmud and  beyond.Parts 3 and 4 deal with the theory of Judaism and Jewish  practices. These are excellent for those who are being introduced to  Judaism for the very first time, or for those who could do with some  revision or brushing up on some of the important rituals, laws and  festivals.Overall, I must say this book is informative and a pleasure to  read and remains an excellent reference book.', 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': 'Comprehensive account of Jewish History and Religion', 'unixReviewTime': 962582400, 'reviewTime': '07 3, 2000'}\n",

A memoir by Ariel Dorfman, the novelist, the exile, living now with his family in Durham, North Carolina, where he holds the Walter Hines Page chair at Duke University.  To a certain extent I did like it, but the author comes over as a smarmy  busy-bee who pokes his nose into everything and inevitably gets himself  into trouble.  He sounds like a nave adolescent, full of himself, pathetic  despite his experiences and accomplishments.  He is an idealist, a quirky  character, a good writer, no doubt an eccentric.What is most incredible  is that the man now lives in the USA despite all his criticism of the  country's influence on the Third World in such books as How to Read Donald  Duck.  A bonus point for the USA for letting him stay, I'd say.  This is  not to say that Dorfman is incorrect in his assumptions though, rather it  begs the question of why did he choose to live in the US?  No doubt, it is  where he is most likely to draw attention to himself, have his books  published, and hold a secure position!  In that he's not much different to  the rest of us at heart, only differing insofar as his writing and exile is  concerned.Heading South, Looking North is an account of Dorfman's  early years in the US, his life in Chile, his involvement during the  Allende years, his struggle with language, namely American English and  Latin American Spanish, and finally his exile from Chile where this book  ends.The chapters alternate between his early years and the Allende  years, before he brings it all together in the closing chapter.  The  writing is often in the present tense and meanders and grinds on and on,  thereby it is easy to lose a grasp of what's being said.  Nonetheless, I  quite liked the style, though much of the time I couldn't see what the fuss  of whether to use Spanish or English was about.  Well, so it's difficult to  be fluent and think and write in both languages.  This is a writer's  dilemma, his agony so to speak, but it's no big deal.  That is unless you  want to make it one, and Dorfman does.  Whatever, he seems to succeed in  his efforts to write in both languages.I feel he uses that theme here  as an overburdened vehicle to the Allende years and his involvement in the  revolution.  A guy like this is bound to be involved in some sort of  revolution or other.  And in this book his supposed squeaky clean honesty  reminds me of modern day politicians, who I do not trust.  I'd be watching  my back if Dorfman was around for sure, he protests too much and I feel  there is definitely something he is not saying although he is supposed to  be saying it all.I look forward to reading a novel by him though.\", 'overall': 3.0, 'summary': 'Mixed feelings', 'unixReviewTime': 937526400, 'reviewTime': '09 17, 1999'}\n"

She knows how to lay out a complicated story on several levels at one time, satisfying both the historian in all of us and also the child who likes to hear a romantic tale.  The book is beautifully done and I\\'m not surprised it has been an international bestseller.  Has it altered our appreciation of the famous movie with Gable and Laughton?  I think not.  All of the versions I\\'ve seen (including the one with Mel Gibson and the notorious Brando one) have some merit, and the story of conflict is one that keeps repeating itself over and over like a nightmare of civilization.  Caroline Alexander sees it as a class fable, in which poor old William Bligh may have whipped a few men here and there, but no worse than the way he was treated as a boy and young man.So continues the cycle of abuse, lo, even unto the next generation.  All in all, a tiptop read.', 'overall': 4.0, 'summary': 'Peter Heywood not so bad as Alexander says', 'unixReviewTime': 1108512000, 'reviewTime': '02 16, 2005'}\n"

I have read every single one of his books, bar none.  Bar none, this was poorest book he has ever written.  The settings, characters, and story line are classic -- you can pick almost everyone of them out of his previous WW II era novels.  It has a lot of plot similarities to Eye of the Needle and Jackdaws.However, the overall plot is extremely predictable.  You can see just what is going to happen after reading the first 25%.  The details however revolve time and time and time again on a  whole series of coincidences which is very out of character for Follett.  I liked most of his books because the story line follows a logical flow with interesting bobs and weaves stemming from an initial premise.  This was more like a low budget movie where things happen by coincidences and characters survive by inches or seconds so many times it becomes unbelievable and ridiculous.The climatic seen of the flight to England has to be the absolutely worst piece of writing ever by Follett.  The events are ridiculous, the characters repeatedly make stupid errors, and the whole thing plays like a cheap B movie.  For instance, are we to believe that the only character who knows how to fly the plane falls asleep during a night flight over water half an hour after almost being shot out of the sky -- and the inexperienced person that's awake lets her sleep?  Or the king of them all, are we to believe the character waits till the airplane is within minutes of running out of gas before remembering to add the extra can of gas he has in the cockpit -- which he could have done 4 hours earlier?  Or how about delaying a day the flight that will change the war and save thousands of lives so that the main character can go to the ballet?  Or how about the German guard helping push the plane out for takeoff because he can't put two and two together?  He must not be related to the other character that can throw a cigar into the cockpit of a small airplane at takeoff speed.Come on Mr. Follett, you can do better.

I wanted to read the words that a depraved sociopath would find interesting. This well read killer was documented to have also been seen reading Melville while imprisoned.  His hanging ended an era of killings, of maybe upwards of 200 people or more. He was well known to have dissected, and incinerate many of the victims, so the true number was never known.

There are paragraph- to page-sized entries on a wide variety of subjects, listed in alphabetical order.  If you\\'re looking for a good cover-to-cover read on Norse mythology, I highly recommend H. R. Ellis Davidson\\'s \"Gods and Myths of Northern Europe\".I own three of these dictionary-style books on Norse mythology, probably THE three such books: Lindow (this book), Rudolf Simek\\'s \"Dictionary of Northern Mythology\" and Andy Orchard\\'s \"Dictionary of Norse Myth & Legend\" (or whatever the current publisher\\'s calling it these days).Of the three, Lindow is by far the most accessible and user-friendly to the layperson.  There\\'s a wealth of information here, and it\\'s written and presented very well and with a healthy amount of humor (one doesn\\'t often see the poem \"Thrymskvida\" described as featuring \"Thor in drag\").That said, it\\'s also true that this book doesn\\'t contain the hoard of detailed, otherwise obscure information that Simek and Orchard have to offer.  On more than one occasion I went to look up something in Lindow and was surprised that it wasn\\'t there.  For example, I find it odd that there\\'s an entry for Ratatosk (a squirrel that inhabits the world tree Yggdrasil, a relatively minor character), but not one for, say, Svartalfaheim (in some accounts, one of the Nine Worlds of Norse mythology, realm of the \"black elfs\", or dwarfs).The bottom line is, if you have a casual interest in Norse mythology and want a well-written, simple reference, then Lindow\\'s your man.  If you want practically everything there is to know about Norse mythology that\\'s available in English, well, Simek or Orchard are probably your best bet.But even if you\\'re going whole hog and decide to get Simek or Orchard, get Lindow too, if for no other reason than that he\\'s an absolute blast to read.', 'overall': 4.0, 'summary': 'Excellent as a jumping-off point', 'unixReviewTime': 1185667200, 'reviewTime': '07 29, 2007'}\n",

In this book, we find out exactly how this happened.It is not a spoiler to say that Viscount Linford married his wife when she was just 16 and married only for her money (promised him by her miserly and misanthropic father), since this appears in the first chapter. We soon learn that he was a rather dissolute rake, but has changed his ways. Linford visits his aunt in London and is introduced to her entrancing friend, Mrs Emily Stowen, who is apparently a widow of means. However, it turns out that Mrs Stowen is neither a widow nor all that unknown to him. If you have read a few romances, you will guess her identity even before the hero does.The rest of the story is taken up with the attempts of Lord Linford to win back his wife through means fair and foul, and how Lady Linford finds her place as chatelaine of a great country estate, despite the machinations of a rather nasty neighbor. There is a sub-plot involving attempted rape and murder, and blackmail, although most of the story is focused around the growing friendship between Linford and his wife.My main problem with the story is that I found a couple of secondary characters - a young neighbor Lucy Maitland (and her family dynamics), and a retired Bow Street runner - far more interesting than the hero and heroine. When this happens, even a decent story loses its attraction. However, this might not happen to you.Anne Ashley writes a competent Regency romance, with nothing really jarring.

Hotchner, that revealed to the world upon its publication in 1966 that Ernest Hemingway died in 1961 not of an accident while cleaning a gun but of an intentional self-inflicted gunshot. If that was all this book had to offer the world on Hemingway, it would not still be in print.  He provides an up close and personal portrait of a man he admired and called a good friend, but a complicated personage all the same.  This is not a critical, exhaustively researched biography weighing 10 pounds; it is memoir by someone who experienced life with the man firsthand, an account that comes across with honesty and enough detail for readers to draw their own critical conclusions.Hotchner was a young writer dispatched by a magazine in 1948 to find the by then world famous Hemingway in Cuba and negotiate an article.  Hotchner's terror at the assignment turned into high surprise as Hemingway took to him and brought him right into his inner circle.  Hotchner never talks about himself really, so we don't know what Hemingway saw in him, but it had to be something because Hemingway was not a man who trusted easily, who required exacting standards in his pals, who also included restaurateur Toots Shor, Marlene Dietrich, Gary Cooper and Ava Gardner.  Hemingway was at the top of his powers in 1948, living as he thought life should be lived and settled in with his fourth and last wife, Mary, who could stand up to him.  On the pretense of editing work, he takes Hotchner along for European adventures, making fun while also disclosing memories of his earlier days, and most important, what inspired his classic novels.  As they move into the 1950's together, Hotchner also catches evidence of Hemingway's battle with mortality.  He has a tough road back to health after surviving a plane crash in Africa, and then, trying to work again, he is bowled over by the response to THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA (the Pulitzer) and the Nobel Prize. Castro, with whom he thought he had an understanding, takes his home and sanctuary.  He is briefly revived in the outdoors of Ketchum, Idaho, but depression and paranoia begin to tear at him.  What now seems a brutal electric shock treatment at the Mayo Clinic, especially for a man who never believed in analysis or being penned up, who wanted to do his own fighting, preceded his death.\", 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': 'Defeat not an option', 'unixReviewTime': 1188259200, 'reviewTime': '08 28, 2007'}\n",

The first-person narrative is such a bold move because it immediately gives a sense of autobiography that a lesser writer would have come across as merely self-indulgent. Yet, he invents an academic figure to \"write\" the foreword - Jakob Haarhuis, a fictional professor of Japanese at NYU, provides an explanation for how the memoirs are gathered, that they are the taped memoirs of the protagonist Sayuri.While it\\'s obvious that Golden has done his research, what takes the book to a higher level is the way he penetrates the psyche of the people caught within the orbit of this cloistered world. The story follows the life of Chiyo, a nine-year old Japanese girl who is sold into slavery along with her older sister Satsu. Because of her unusual grey eyes, Chiyo is then sold to an okiya (boardinghouse for geishas). The scenes in the okiya are Golden\\'s most meticulous and accomplished, especially as Chiyo undergoes a grueling apprenticeship and competes with the beautiful, worldly but wholly spiteful Hatsumomo, who is the okiya\\'s star geisha. Men become bewitched by her poise and subservient manner, and she takes her new name, Sayuri, symbolizing her metamorphosis into a professional geisha. Surviving some unsavory escapades with some of the okiya\\'s most undesirable patrons, Sayuri surpasses Hatsumomo in stature and becomes the mistress of the man she had set her heart on all along, the benevolent chairman of an electrical supply company.While a more predictable story would have stopped there with the love story, the author goes further and has Sayuri move to New York to run a salon for visiting Japanese businessmen until the chairman dies. In a certain way, I wish Golden did stop the book in Japan when WWII ends in the story. The chapters afterward feel rushed as if the author is losing interest in her story and wants the reader to get to the inevitable ending quickly. Regardless, Golden fills the book with vivid images and subtle descriptions of the nuances of Japanese culture. Absolutely invaluable in its detail if sometimes too overwhelming to appreciate at once (a repeated reading is recommended), the story reflects a brilliant eye for the customs and rituals within geisha society, including its politics, rivalries, and traditions. Having been to the historic Gion district of Kyoto, where present-day geishas still live, I have caught a glimpse of these women scurrying about in their beautiful kimonos looking both fetching and anachronistic. Golden captures their stories with compassion and an anthropologist\\'s fervor. This is strongly recommended both as fiction and an essential ingredient of Japan\\'s cultural history.', 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': \"Behind the White Mask Lie Further Layers of Subverted Identity in Golden's Sharply Observed Novel\", 'unixReviewTime': 1131753600, 'reviewTime': '11 12, 2005'}\n",

This nonfiction book describes the origin of the first effective in vitro cell line (HeLa cells) from a poor black woman.

The side stories tell about life in the rural south as tobacco farmers, scraping to make ends meet by putting the entire family to work; life in the slums of Philadelphia plagued by child abuse, drugs, and violence; and the challenges for many poorly educated citizens to understand modern medicine, technology, and economics.In short, \"The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks\" is a compelling book about the interface of science and society, written for the general public but a wonderful \"read\" for both nonscientists and scientists alike.

Obviously hard to find unless one uses Protestant books. I purchased this book, but immediately felt disappointed. I am an at-home, homeschooling, very traditional Catholic woman, and some of the reflections rubbed me the wrong way, or were hard to relate to, because they were so contemporary and did not seem universal enough to apply to my life. They also struck me less as meditations and more as anecdotes. However, after awhile, the book began having an unexpected effect on me which, while different than I expected, was positive nonetheless. While I could not relate to some of the anecdotes or reflections, I did find myself learning more and more about how to apply scripture to my life, beyond the obvious ways the Church has always taught. It was as if, by relating the experiences and thoughts of other women, the book was giving me permission to insert my own story, my own sufferings and struggles and joys, into salvation history. So, while I do not find myself meditating on the given reflections in the way I expected, they DO inspire meditation! A second positive effect is, I find myself obsessively reading scripture out of curiosity as to what the next reflection will be! Three words of caution: First, while some reflections are only a page or two apart, occasionally there are many pages between daily reflections. In that case, one must make a choice of reading many pages, or skip large sections of the Bible to keep pace with the sequence of reflections. Second, there are a few reflections which are questionable in terms of theological accuracy. One example describes Christ\\'s birth as involving pain, blood, and an umbilical cord, which sounds to me like a denial of the Virgin Birth. Another cautions us against allowing our religious rituals to come between us and another person; this can be read in an acceptably orthodox way as advising us not to be too rigid, but could also be read as permission to skip Mass in the name of charity. Third, I am personally not fond of the inclusive-language translation of the NRSV. I realize it is approved by the Church, but sometimes in the awkward effort to use inclusive language, the meaning is diluted or completely altered. For example, sometimes the word \"man\" is used not simply to refer generically to any human being, but is meant to refer to Adam, either literally or figuratively. Therefore, changing it to \"person\" or \"humankind\" loses some of the intended meaning. As does the use of \"students\" in place of \"brothers\"; clearly those words are not synonymous. Thankfully, there are footnotes indicating the original words whenever these alterations are used. But these alterations seem unnecessary; I don\\'t know of any woman who has ever been offended by the original language of the Bible, which was, after all, authored by God. Overall, a worthwhile book. I would like to see a somewhat different version for women, perhaps drawing more heavily upon women saints than contemporary authors, and with reflections which are more truly meditative than anecdotal,using a non-incusive-language text.', 'overall': 4.0, 'summary': 'Grew To Like This Book', 'unixReviewTime': 1167350400, 'reviewTime': '12 29, 2006'}\n",

If you have ever listened to Governor Romney speak, this book reads like a long speech. It is readily comprehensible, plainly spoken, and frequently well versed.It is so named because Obama\\'s apology tours, denigrating America, are well known, and heinous for any American elected or appointed official to do, much less for the President of America. Obama should apologize for apologizing, and the best way for America to ensure he does that is to support great folks like Mitt Romney.Sometimes this book is not well versed.He addresses many problems facing America today. Overall he addresses them well, with some disagreements, some ignorance, some shortchanging, and some omissions.He names Russia, China, and Islamofascism as the three main foreign policy threats we face, plus he includes the somewhat minor actors such as Chavez in Venuesuela, Kim in North Korea, etc.His call for ensuring that Iran does not acquire nuclear weapons is stirring, but not stirring enough. His call for an anti-missile defense system is good, but not good enough. His warning of the threat of an Electro Magnetic Attack (EMP) on the US is brief; it is over in one mild paragraph. He does not really tie these three together as he should have. He does not really elaborate on what Iran and the rest of the world could/would do if Iran does become a nuclear power.He does not mention that we need a perfect anti-missile defense system to deter an EMP attack, for which we would only have 30 seconds warning from launch to detonation, and that is not enough time to react except automatically. Three missiles launched from three container ships off of our coasts could successfully send most of the USA back to the stone age with only 30 seconds warning, and Iran could mount such an attack.He does not cover, as Newt Gingrich does, as Mike Huckabee does, and the Heritage Foundation does, and as the Clarion Foundation does, how a successful EMP attack on the USA would be a civilization killer. He says we would be without electricity, but he doesn\\'t say that it would last for two or three years, and that over 90% of all Americans would die in the first year due to starvation, disease, and violence as civilization totally collapsed. I recommend \"One Second After\" by Newt Gingrich\\'s frequent co-author, William Forstchen, which, in novelization form as no attack has yet happened, is an accurate representation of the danger such an attack would be.Romney does not elaborate on how to keep Iran from accquiring nuclear weapons, what we shoud do besides toothless sanctions, or what to do if Iran does acquire nuclear weapons, which the Obama administration will allow Iran to do (i.e. will do nothing to deter or stop them).He covers all bases regarding Climate Change, coming down, sort of, on the side of adapting to climate change, rather than implementing a job killing tax increasing ponzi scheme like cap and trade. However, one has to question whether this is a subject the Governor really studied, for if he had, he would know that climate change is entirely natural; that CO2 is not the causative factor in climate change, and that man is not the cause either. As the East Anglia E-mails state, there has been 15 years of global cooling - is that also caused by CO2? It is a shame that the Governor really didn\\'t do his homework on this subject.Governor Romney has read \"America Alone\", by Mark Steyn, which covers the demographics that are going to turn most of the rest of the world\\'s countries into Islamist countries well before the end of this century. He has called it a powerful book, and has recommended that all members of his staff read it. The operative question is whether or whether not the USA can survive as the last Western Civilization country on this Earth.Governor Romney does not address how to keep the Chechen Muslims, like those who took over the Belsan school and slaughtered over 100 kids, from taking over Russia. What kind of threat will an Islamist Russia with all of their nuclear capablilities be? He doesn\\'t address the Threat from all of Western Europe becoming an Islamist continent, including nuclear armed France, overrun by the Muslim Brotherhood (who tried to blow up the twin towers in 1993), and what kind of threat that will be to America\\'s security. He doesn\\'t address the Threat of nuclear armed England, when the Deobondi sect of Islam (the Pakistan version of the Wahhabi sect that all 19 of the 9/11 killers adhered to) takes over England. He doesn\\'t address the threat of Islamist Canada being overrun by Wahhabism and becoming a springboard for invading the USA by these Islamists around the world. He doesn\\'t address the threat of large sections of Central and South America becoming Islamist countries. He doesn\\'t address the threat of Islam to the continued existence fo the USA as a non-Islamist country, and that becoming an Islamist country is a very, very bad event for our progeny. If we do lose this global war, as we are headed towards, and become an Islamist country, nothing, else, absolutely nothing else we are discussing today will matter.Governor Romney needs to spend some quality time with the U.S. House of Representatives Anti-Terrorism Caucus, chaired by Rep Sue Myrick (R-NC).As something needed to do to strengthen America, which he believes in firmly, fortunately, strengthening the traditional family, the real family, is a key part of his strategy and this book. His discussion of the actions needed is more thoruogh and detailed than even his economic analysis. This part of his book should be studied and his recommendations taken to heart by every American Politician of all political parties.Governor Romney has said on his book tour interview that this book is not about social values, and I accept his explanation.Overall, this is a worthwhile book, with many good recommendations. The flaws, and ignorance the Governor displays on some subjects, including the omissions, make this book deserving of a follow up book to properly address them.Governor Romney could have perfected this book without much more effort, and it\\'s a shame that he didn\\'t take the time to do it right in the first place.', 'overall': 3.0, 'summary': 'No apology is an apt title, but apologies are needed for omissions', 'unixReviewTime': 1268179200, 'reviewTime': '03 10, 2010'}\n",

Farrar\\'s beauty, fiery temper, and numerous flirtations become part of the plot in which a visiting French baritone who has antagonized everyone uses a throat spray laced with ammonia. His vocal chords, indeed his voice, are permanently damaged. \"He might as well be dead,\" intones Farrar, and soon her words come true. With herself as a major suspect, Farrar, urged on by Enrico Caruso, initiates her own investigation, which turns out to be a delightful romp.Surrounding Farrar are stars who were a major part of her life during the Mets \"golden age.\" The author has created wonderful fictional sketches of Caruso, Pucinni, Emmy Destinn, Pasquale Amato, Toscanini, and actor David Belasco. Even Farrar\\'s young female fans, the famous \"gerryflappers,\" are given a part to play. The short Epilogue tells you what happened to these personalities in the following years.A more serious leitmotif is the constant references to the looming European war. Most of the singers are from lands increasingly drawn into the conflict. Memories of good times there are recalled amid the growing realization that that the war might last, that America may be drawn into it, and that the inevitable war relief tours will become standard fare. These tense moments are lighten by descriptions of the singers hangouts, the Met and Belasco theaters, Mulberry Street on the Italian immigrant Lower East Side, and, above all, the numerous backstage dramas.', 'overall': 3.0, 'summary': 'United States - New York, 1915', 'unixReviewTime': 1247616000, 'reviewTime': '07 15, 2009'}\n",

My sister loves books and being intrigued by beautiful cover art is how she chooses the books she is going to read, and it seems to work for her every time. I decided to try it this time with HALO.The summary on the inside sleeve of the book is decent enough to make you wanna read, and the first few chapters are quite easy to read through. There were times at the start of reading HALO that I was reading 5 chapters a day. I was impressed that Miss Adornetto was only 18-years-old when HALO was released. Her writing style was mature and descriptive. I was jealous at how easily writing seemed to come to her, when I\\'m older than her and struggle nearly every day to get my story ideas down on paper.However, getting past the angels settling in to their new environment, my opinion about HALO quickly went downhill. At first it was easy to look past Bethany\\'s naive in-take on everything, as this was her first time on earth and being human. But you\\'d think living in Heaven, watching humans live every day life from above would have given her a brain. I mean, you\\'d think instinctively she\\'d know right from wrong, but it was so easy for her to fall right into the role of being a teenager. Vanity and Xavier were the only things that mattered to her.There\\'s one part in HALO where Bethany attends her first teenaged house party, a party in which her beloved Xavier saves her from, and actually gets drunk off some alcohol because her brother Gabriel told her that humans have to keep hydrated.After the party Bethany starts to see Xavier more, sneaking out of the house one night to see him. It seems so easy for her to disobey her siblings and lose sight of their original reason for being on earth in the first place. She\\'s totally caught up in Xavier, thinking about him, talking about him, doing everything with him. It even gets to the point of not being able to exist without him. Xavier starts to annoy when he becomes overprotective of Bethany, insisting that she eat and drink regularly. As one reviewer said: he even plays airplane with her to get her to eat a power bar.Then, one day at school after talking to her girl friends, Bethany is influenced to bring up sex with Xavier, asking him if he\\'d ever thought about doing it with her and if he and his dead girlfriend Emily had a \"physical relationship\" too. This particular scene bothered me the most. Actually, Bethany brought up Emily a lot, wondering if she was as good as Emily.I found Bethany to be very weak and lacking a lot of faith. She often whined to Xavier, questioning his love for her and crying over the moment she\\'d have to return to Heaven, never to see or be with Xavier again. There\\'s one part that reminded me a lot of Bella from New Moon, just after Edward breaks up with her, where she\\'s depressed because she can\\'t live without her \"other half.\"Then there\\'s the new mysterious kid in school, Jake Thorne, who immediately gave me the impression he was bad news. Adornetto gave no mystery to this guy, describing him in dark clothing, long black hair and high cheek bones. Slowly but surely the goth students started to hang around him. There was no surprise when the rugby match came around and a dark figure stood across the field just before Xavier Woods took a fall and broke his leg and got a minor concussion. I knew right away it was Jake Thorne. Bethany acknowledged the figure but didn\\'t take much concern to it. You would think being an angel sent to earth to get rid of dark forces she could have sensed more from a dark force, which brings me to...Gabriel. When Jake attends the prom with Bethany due to the fact that Xavier had a concussion, he threatens her. Xavier says he can take Jake down but Gabriel insists that Jake is of dark forces, that no one knows exactly what he is or what he is capable of, that they need to find out first. He repeats this often, yet I never felt he put much effort into figuring out what exactly Jake was.Overall, I was disappointed in this book. I read it in a week and can\\'t believe I wasted my time. Luckily I only requested it free from the library. I wanted so badly to like this book, as the cover was amazing; I wanted to be able to have it on my book shelf. Apparently the picking-a-book-by-its-cover method doesn\\'t work for me as it does for my sister.HALO actually makes me feel angry every time I talk about it. The angels are weak; Bethany is too obsessive, too whine-y and too naive. Castiel from the TV show Supernatural isn\\'t as ridiculously stupid as these angels are. I do not recommend this book... unless you\\'re a huge fan of the Twilight saga and just want a story exactly the same, but instead of vampires and werewolves you get angels and demons.', 'overall': 1.0, 'summary': 'A beautiful cover with a fallen plotline', 'unixReviewTime': 1310083200, 'reviewTime': '07 8, 2011'}\n",

When I was about halfway finished, I ordered the hardcover copy, and the second book in the series -- it was just that good. I finally finished Kushiel\\'s Dart tonight, and felt inclined to write about it.This is not your typical fantasy. While there definitely are fantastic elements, there is no superhuman sorcery, no elves and goblins. Most of the fantasy in the book is reimagined history -- and that part is superbly done. It takes place in a Europe (Europa) of probably the 1000\\'s, with France (Terre d\\'Ange) being the most sophisticated country, more Renaissance-like than medieval. Much of the rest of the world, however, is delightfully primitive. Christianity is not dominate -- in fact, only a few Jew-like Christians are around in this world, although it is generally accepted by the French (D\\'Angelines) that there was a Jesus. England (Alba, which is definitely a well-researched name) is Pictish, and Germany is inhabited by barbarian Norsemen. The names for everything are perfect -- Hellas (Hellenism is the age of Alexander the Great) for Greece, Tiberium for Rome, Aragonia (think Ferdinand of Aragon) for Spain. It feels like she put a lot of thought into designing her world.The plot, too, is excellent. The main character is not your typical fantasy \"chick\" -- she doesn\\'t fight, magically or physically, and some things about her are almost repulsive. Pricked by Kushiel\\'s Dart, she feels pain as sexual pleasure -- and, thus, becomes very useful as a bed-partner to those with sadistic tastes. Still, I liked her quite a bit, and found her a very believable heroine. She saves her homeland -- through the use of her sexual skills, her beauty, and her wits.Plenty of people have criticized this book for being \"porn\". It really isn\\'t pornographic at all. There are vivid sex scenes, but they aren\\'t disgusting or pornographic. I wouldn\\'t recommend this book to a 12-year-old fantasy fan, but I wouldn\\'t warn anyone away from it due to the explicitness of the sex scenes.And the writing! The writing was just beautiful. Poetic, surpassing even the beauty of Tolkien. The heroine lives in a land of beauty and elegance, where every D\\'Angeline is descended from angels, and has their beauty. It follows that the language would be beautiful as well.An excellent book. Ten stars out of ten.

I was quietly made aware of their real mission and being young, naive and wanting to \"take it to the enemy\" thought it was a good idea. I was in command when COL R. made his inspection tour sometime in the Spring of 1969. I think 1LT Martin was off site but COL R. seemed to already know about his operation. LTC B, my immediate boss did not know about it and I had to fill him in on what little I knew. LTC B quickly understood and did not ask anymore questions. About the time I was preparing to leave for the States 1LT Martin was wrapping up his operation with a lot of haste. I had no idea what had happened until I returned to the States and heard about it on the news. Little did I know how close I was to such a historical event.

Like any of us, they are faced with the reality of their situations and grow to overcome many (but not all) of their flaws.Weeks writes with a very visual style, giving your imagination plenty, but not too much, information to go on. Cities are painted to reflect their hidden nature, castle halls come to life through the action, and forests seem to have their own storyline. It can be hard to put the series down once you've picked it up.Why four stars then? A matter of personal taste. Weeks delves into some deep psychological areas of his characters, and doesn't shy away from some dark matters. Rape, Cannibalism, Torture are all included, and in some ways normalized. He's also liberally uses profanity. All of it fits within the world and characters he's created -- very little of it was jilted outside of the story. If those things don't bother you inside of a good story, then you'll deeply enjoy the Night Angel series. If you can overlook them in the context of the story, you'll find a deep world that will have you thinking about the characters after you've closed the cover. It left me wondering if Weeks could accomplish the same thing in the lines of Sanderson or Jordan without going into the nitty gritty of the darker side, and instead letting it merely exist with his characters.Nonetheless, a well written series, and with that caveat, worth the read!\", 'overall': 4.0, 'summary': 'Great series, but...', 'unixReviewTime': 1339286400, 'reviewTime': '06 10, 2012'}\n",

Now I personally have the balance and coordination of a drunken ostrich on a good day, so dancing isn't exactly my forte. But I love and respect the elegance of dance, both choreographed and improv. I admire the dedication people have to this sport; they constantly and consciously inflict damage and pain on their body to achieve that perfect move, that perfect moment. I found myself just as captivated by Sophie Flack's Bunheads as surely as if I were watching a live ballet.Watching dancers on stage or in a movie was one thing, but I wasn't sure about how I would enjoy reading about them. I often find that when a book revolves around a specific sport or hobby that isn't as well known, it can be somewhat offsetting to the reader. We don't understand the technical jargon that the writer casually tosses about, but I felt Flack handled herself wonderfully. If I didn't completely understand a move or maneuver, the rest of the description in the page was more times than not enough compensation. And while the novel does focus heavily on dance, it's so much more than that.Hannah struggles as a dancer translate easily to life. She's making decisions now as a young adult that will not only shape her career, but her life. After devoting her life to dance, Hannah starts to yearn for something more. While she still loves dance, she starts to realize she's missing the little things in life that we non-dancers take for granted regularly. When she meets Jacob she starts to really notice all those little things and that adds up into one big question: Can she have both ballet and a life of her own?With Flack's background as a dancer, this novel could have easily slid into the category of preachy and confusing. There is no doubt that Flack knows her stuff when it comes to ballet, but there's a fine line between knowing and writing. I must say that Flack danced that thin line with the finesse one would expect of a ballet dancer. This book is graceful, fast, and intoxicating to watch unfold.\", 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': 'The Irish Banana Review', 'unixReviewTime': 1324944000, 'reviewTime': '12 27, 2011'}\n",

Brown is a delightful read--one especially suited for those taking Web programming courses or wanting to learn the inside strategies on Web site design/programming preparation.The book starts off by covering the fundamentals of wireframes, personas, site maps, concept models, and flowcharts.  These components of the book are not only technical in a how-to format, but also practical in a business sense.  In fact, Dan Brown makes a point of stressing how to negotiate these \"deliverables\" in business meetings, in essence preparing the reader for a career in design strategies.The second part of the book not only emphasizes how to format the products (i.e., wireframes, personas, etc) into professional deliverables through providing structure for the reports, but also delves into competitive reviews, usability plans, and usability reports.  Of most interest to me was the competitive review, as it helped establish the framework (including site map) of a site I\\'m about to build.  One easily overlooked shortcoming of the book is that it doesn\\'t spend the time on research strategies, such as focus groups and interviews that the book A Project Guide To UX Design by Russ Unger does.  However, Communicating Design exceeds many other books in its elaboration on the personas, wireframes, site maps, flow carts, etc.--the actual deliverables.Although the book doesn\\'t delve into how to create the deliverables in different software programs (it only mentions a few of the usable programs like Illustrator and Microsoft Visio, for instance), one can go to Lynda.com for a month-to-month membership and access tutorials on these components.  Communicating Design shows, instead, how to create the different deliverables, how to conduct oneself in business presentations of the deliverables, and how to format them into impressive reports.It is also important to note that Dan Brown\\'s second edition felt more cumbersome at first, due to its wide size, but after spending time with the interior of the book, the read was quite pleasant.  The pages were glossed with lots of white space and friendly diagrams.Dan Brown\\'s book proved essential in helping me prepare for the initial design set-up of a Website, and I would argue that the steps he provides in his book are almost indispensable to making an excellent site.

It was a shock.  I assumed that everyone experienced music the same way.  Wrong!Do you ever ask anyone what happens when they hear music?  I didn't before I read this book.  Now I plan to ask everyone.Dr. Sacks has the kind of fine writing style and awareness of music that makes his tales seem as appealing as the cases that Dr. Sigmund Freud wrote about.  As Dr. Sacks pointed out, Dr. Freud didn't care for music so that gentleman failed to investigate and report on many of the phenomena in this book.We don't exactly know why the mind and body interact with music in the ways that they do.  Part is undoubtedly heredity.  Part is undoubtedly due to exposure to musical influences.  Some may relate to the language spoken in the home.  Difficulties with seeing may also be an influence.  Injuries to the body and brain can play a large role.  Dr. Sacks does a masterly job of using case after case to explore one aspect or another of these dimensions so that a complex picture emerges that's even more remarkable than the brain processes involved in reading.One of the biggest surprises in the book is that musical talent seems to be inhibited by some parts of the brain.  In similar way, music can also inhibit some other brain functions that we would like to get rid of.I had always wondered about those with perfect pitch, and the book explores that.  There are also wonderful sections on other seemingly inherited musical abilities.Dr. Sacks adds a lot of perspective to the history of music by making observations about various composers and the way that their compositions reflect certain musical abilities than others while explaining how the mental processes are different. Today, we can map the brain's activation in order to get clues about why certain behaviors are possible.  That final perspective adds a lot to the case histories.If you are like me, you'll find some of the cases to be heart-wrenching.  I was comforted a bit to realize that music made those sad lives better so there's reason to rejoice in that sense.So what was my big personal discovery?  When I listen to classical music of any kind, I can choreograph a ballet along with costumes, sets, and props to go along with the music that I see in color when I close my eyes . . . even if the music has never been used for ballet.

You can flip the book open to any page and pull out something worth reading aloud and for that alone, I'd take my hat off to the man.  But beneath the distracting beauty of the prose is a very familiar story.  A good man returned from a bad war in a small town with a dark side, in this case, Sicilian gangsters, including the worst of the worst, a one eyed knifeman.  Sound familiar?  It is.  Gatreaux is at his best when he's wrapped in descriptions of the little lumber town called Nimbus, but the characters who populate it are prone to portentuous talk and symbolic actions.  We have riffs on Greek myths, serpents in beds, man mountains engaged in knife fights in rivers, but I found little to persuade me from the thought that Gatreaux was bluffing with a weak hand.  Namely, that at the center of the novel, lie a pair of brothers that he doesn't seem to have a handle on.  The war veteran has apparently killed scores of men, so that he is accustomed to doling out death in close quarters, yet over 95% of men in World War One were killed through shelling or machine guns, both distant intervention.  It was this, the blindness of fate, that you couldn't see who you were killing, or who was killing you, that was responsible for much of the pressure described as shell shock.  Gatreaux's veteran comes across then as a mythic figure, but the author seems to want us to believe in the grit and truth of his town.  I found it ultimately impossible, when I couldn't believe in the grit and truth of his characters, leaving the book with a hollow beauty, disappointing despite the promise.\", 'overall': 3.0, 'summary': \"Writing can't disguise the weakness of the plot\", 'unixReviewTime': 1064880000, 'reviewTime': '09 30, 2003'}\n",

Ever human's IQ soars to 400 or something like that.This book suffers from the problem a lot of sci fi books have - the author isn't really able to conceive of what people that smart would think or do, or invent because - well - the author isn't that smart; so aside from characters being able to conceive of new differential equations on the fly (some people can already do that, I'd bet) and invent new languages there isn't much happening here.The funny part is everybody with a boring job (that is to say, everybody except the scientists) simply quit working so there is no food or anything to buy.

The action centers on Jim and Frank, young colonists on Mars, and Jim's 'pet', Willis.  Mars is run by the Company who supplies the colonists needs, including a boarding school for high school aged colonists and organizing the annual migration.  As Jim and Frank (and Willis) arrive at school they discover that not everyone working for the Company has the colonists best interests at heart.  The kind head master is replaced by an autocratic bully who promptly confiscates all guns and pets - including Willis.  While rescuing Willis the boys uncover a more serious plot and soon the three are fleeing across the planet to warn their families.This book is very much a precursor to STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND, the descriptions of the Martians, their culture, and abilities are very much the same.  The basic story is one of RAH's typical youngster(s) same their society with the help of friendly aliens, very much in the same vein as, PODKAYNE, HAVE SPACESUIT WILL TRAVEL, THE STAR BEAST etc.  As always with RAH's stories it is exciting, has more than a few interesting twists and will probably cause the reader to re-examine some long held beliefs.  It also has some more annoying RAH traits - the women are definitely there to feed the men and raise the children, the characters are all either completely good or completely bad.  RAH's familiar themes of 'arms make the citizen', 'big government is bad government', 'the aliens will save us' and 'women need to be protected by men' are also all there as well.This is a fun read, for both adults and children.

Yes, I do expect a book purporting to teach me historical facts to get basic grammar and usage correct.-In the introduction, she tells of Elizabeth translating a work she calls \\'Mirror or Glass of a Sinful Soul,\\' and on the next page for some reason she tells much the same story and refers to the work as \\'Mirror of a Sinful Soul.\\'  Such redundancy and sloppiness would have caused me to get a paper returned with a failing grade on it when I was a freshman in college.Oooh, but it\\'s fun!

An ambitious young woman reporter for The World newspaper in New York suddenly thought she could possibly beat that record in real life, alone.  She studied timetables and planned before approaching her boss and talking him into the journey.  She would set out by ship from Hoboken, NJ and finish there in less than 80 days.News of her race against time spread quickly.  It inspired the editor of Cosmopolitan (which was a totally different publication pre-Helen Gurley Brown) to send one of his columnists in the opposite direction in hopes of beating the World reporter.So Nelly Bly, reporter extraordinaire, and Elizabeth Bisland, beautiful, sophisticated literary type set out on their race.  Nelly Bly was a pseudonym taken from a popular song of the day.  She didn't know about Bisland's attempt until they practically crossed paths in the Far East.This is a long book of nearly 400 pages but my interest in it never flagged.  One ad I saw compared Goodman's handling of the story to Erik Larson and I agree.  There are pictures of the people and places and modes of transport to help the reader feel part of the exciting trip.  Complications abounded for both women as weather, miscommunications, and mechanical problems with ships and steamers conspired to slow them down.One funny part of Nelly Bly's story is that she was suddenly approached by several young men, one at a time, who seemed eager to marry her.  Rumor had it that she was an heiress who was traveling to mend a broken heart.  Her sudden suitors were looking for someone wealthy to support them, and at least one didn't mind saying so.  Finally she told one young man that it was all an act; actually she was quite poor and a friend had paid for her trip.  That was the end of the suitors.I won't ruin the story by telling you who won the race but even afterward the story of the two women and the rest of their life is fascinating.  In retrospect, I suppose I could have predicted their fate, but then again maybe not.Highly recommended readingSource:  Amazon Vine\", 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': 'Women Attempt to Outdo Phileas Fogg in 1890s', 'unixReviewTime': 1359676800, 'reviewTime': '02 1, 2013'}\n",

You very rarely see that in romances, and I really appreciate it. There\\'s no reason not to have a blind hero in a romance novel. I loved Vincent as a character. He seemed real to me...he was a man who had accepted his disability with dignity, yet, was still at odd times overwhelmed by panic attacks in relation to it. His emotions ran the gamut, and I liked that. I also liked Sophia...to a point. She just seemed a bit too one-dimensional to me. Her only \"flaw,\" if you could call it that, was that she was not necessarily beautiful. But, the author seemed to solve that with new clothes and a hair cut. Besides her Aunt, Uncle and cousin, everyone else loved her, even if they initially thought she was unattractive on first meeting her, that opinion changed rapidly, and they ended up loving her. Even the \"evil\" cousin she had that ruined her self-esteem came off as an idiot that really didn\\'t dislike her. She never had a bad word to say about anyone....she was just a bit too \"goody-goody\" for me. I need to see that she\\'s got some flaw, or she just doesn\\'t seem real.The story overall was good, and I did like the way that Sophia came up with all of these ideas to help Vincent out on his estate. But, again, Sophia has all the ideas. Everyone else seems to be clueless. Another way that the Sophia character is too perfect. All that perfectness made for a bland story. There was really no conflict at all. There was some potential conflict that could have happened between Sophia and Martin, Vincent\\'s valet. But it just seemed like Martin disliked Sophia, then went away from the story for awhile, then came back and loved Sophia like everyone else did. So much for conflict. I really need some kind of \"spice\" to my stories. This one really had none.

But for the most part, I enjoyed it. Of course, this isn't a story about the first blush of love or the first stirrings of passion. Laren and Alex have been married for about five years. They were wonderfully in love when they exchanged their vows, but the crushing loss of a baby three years ago drove a wedge between them that they have not been able to overcome.The book opens with the MacKinloch clan under attack. Their homes are burned to the ground and Laren is injured. Despite her wounds, she doesn't turn to her husband. And it's his fear of her death coupled with the realization of her distance that wakes Alex up to the serious chasm between them. He vows to fix things, but watching the two of them try to reconcile is frustrating and sad. Alex is the chief of the tribe and he expects Laren to be the lady of his people. But she is terribly shy and her childhood as a poor outcast makes her feel unable and unworthy to be what her husband wants her to be. Instead, she finds her solace in glassmaking. It's a skill she learned from an old priest after her son's death. She finds beauty and purpose in her art and she has done it for years in secret.Laren's glass can generate the money they clan needs to rebuild. But Alex feels betrayed that she has kept this secret all these years. The two of them clearly love each other. However, it's difficult to watch them blunder through their relationship. Alex lords over Laren the same way he rules the clan. He tries to bend her to his will. Though admittedly, his intentions are good, he does real damage to her spirit and makes her feel that he doesn't value her for who she is. At the same time, Laren is guilty of being a martyr. She hides her feelings and keeps her secrets by telling herself Alex doesn't need to be burdened by them. I wanted to just shake them both, especially during the first half of the book.Things do get better, though, as our couple begins to understand and accept each other. And watching them finally come together is quite lovely. There is deep loss and sadness in their relationship, but there is real love there, which makes their journey worth watching... especially once they begin to communicate.An external threat does hover over our couple, in the form of the clan's enemy... who is trying to crush the MacKinlochs once and for all. Also, we've got some strong secondary characters, like Alex's brothers, which give the book more depth. I'm really interested to read poor Callum's story --and I hope it comes next.Overall, I found that I did enjoy this, especially once our couple started actually talking to each other. 4 stars.*ARC Provided by NetGalley\", 'overall': 4.0, 'summary': 'Finding love again', 'unixReviewTime': 1310860800, 'reviewTime': '07 17, 2011'}\n"

I was interested to learn about his relationships with other illustrators and artists, his personality and family, and his own view of the art world and his place in it.  Although I grew up with Rockwell\\'s covers on the Saturday Evening Post that were delivered to my family\\'s home every week, before reading this book I knew little about him as a person.Solomon\\'s a good writer and the book is a quick, easy read.  She focuses more on the events of Rockwell\\'s life than on his art, although the art is not neglected.  She seems to be writing more for the general reader than the art academic.What I found strange was Solomon\\'s references to Rockwell\\'s sexual issues, not that he really had any, that we are told of, but she gives us little off-hand remarks about homoerotic issues, and say . . . was there a latent pedophile lurking inside Norman?  I could not figure out her purpose.  Did she feel she needed to juice the book up a bit - in many ways Rockwell was sort of boring, not your drunken womanizer type male artist who\\'s relatively easy to write about - was she trying to establish her own creds with the gender studies and queer theory crowd, or is she subconsciously driven by repressed gender identity issues of her own?  Interpret at your own risk (phrase borrowed from Solomon herself - below).As a illustration (yes) of Solomon\\'s bizarreness, after planting the homoerotic, homosexual and pedophile issues in your mind, she comes (yes, intentional, read on) to write about a mural Rockwell did for the Nassau Inn in Princeton, N.J., which included an image of Yankee Doodle.  The first line of the Yankee Doodle song was to be written on the mural.  Was it \"Yankee Doodle came to town,\" or Yankee Doodle went to town.\"  The \"debate\" was written up in the July 17, 1937, issue of The New Yorker magazine.In Solomon\\'s telling: \"Princeton\\'s board of trustees took a vote; it resulted in a tie.  Rockwell settled on the word \\'came\\'.  Interpret at your own risk.\"  \"Come\" on, Debbie.  Not only that, if one goes back, as I did, and reads the entire original piece in The New Yorker, it\\'s clear the word \"came\" was chosen, but it is not clear that it was Rockwell\\'s choice.  Go figure.My recommendation: read the book but forgive Solomon\\'s overly fertile mind and ignore the obvious absurdities.', 'overall': 4.0, 'summary': 'A good book, but a very strange one', 'unixReviewTime': 1392249600, 'reviewTime': '02 13, 2014'}\n",

In essay after essay, I found myself saying,\"Go on, Joan. You said it, Joan. We are the same, you and I, Joan, etc.\" That is the type of book Slouching Towards Bethlehem is. Reading it, slowly, meticulously, I felt such a close kinship, a bond, not with the writer but with her words -- so carefully chosen and wonderfully articulated. These essays are not meant, honestly, for teenagers, although, if given a chance, the totality of the book would be most beneficial for their pliable and socially indoctrinated minds.The purport of this book is something that I can so easily identify with: the disappearance of the past for the establishment of a fragmented, roughly organized new society with newfangled, unaccustomed societal perceptions as well as an aggressive casting off of the traditional value system of those who were born and raised a long time before the emergence of the radical, cataclysmic sixties. These essays explore, through author Joan Didion\\'s own feelings and experiences and the feelings and experiences of those she encountered, the disharmononized emotions of the hippy generation vs the elders of the more reactionary periods, periods where: Free Love, Acid Trips, Groovy, Crystal Snorting Gurus and Muumuu Dressed Followers seemed a complex and social oddity in the hierarchy of those who were deemed, \"Not with it, man.\"What is so nice about these essays is that they are not condescending; there were and are thousands upon thousands of citizens and non-citizens alike who had and have no clue whatsoever as to what the counter-culture represented (me, honestly, being one in that vast catagory). Joan Didion thrust herself into its epicenter, and with a keen eye took it all in, trying to understand. The darkness of the counter-culture I think is best represented in the title essay \"Slouching Towards Bethlehen\" on page 101:  \"Pretty little 16-year-old chick comes to the Haight to see what it\\'s all about & gets picked up by a 17-year-old street dealer who spends all day shooting her full of speed again & again, then feeds her 3,000 mikes & raffles off her temporarily unemployed body for the biggest Hight Street gangbang since the night before last. The politics and ethics of ecstasy...\"  That was the darkness of the counter-culture, but that is not representative of the entirety of it. Didion\\'s family can be traced back all the way to the Donner-Reed tragedy in which cannibalism was the well known result. Thus, California is liked to that sole dark act; it is forever historically and symbolically linked, California becoming tarnished and not the land of \"Golden opportunity.\" That is one way of looking at the counter-culture. Or it can be viewed in this fashion, in the essay: \"Rock of Ages\" about Alcatraz Island on page 208:\"I saw the shower room (in Alcatraz) with the soap still in the dishes. I picked up a yellowed program from an Easter service...and I struck a few notes on an upright piano with the ivory all rotted from the keys and I tried to imagine the prison as it had been, with the big lights playing over the windows all night long and the guards patrolling the gun galleries and the silverware clattering into a bag as it was checked in after meals, tried dutifully to summon up some distaste, some night terror of the doors locking and the boat pulling away. But the fact of it was that I liked it out there, a ruin devoid of human vanities, clean of human illusion, and empty place reclaimed by the weather where a woman plays an organ to stop the wind\\'s whining and an old man plays ball with a dog named Duke...\"Maybe that is what the hippy generation was trying to flee from: \"Human vanities. Human illusions.\"Slouching Towards Bethlehem is a book where the search for meaning is in of itself the comprehension of change.

And despite some of the negative reviews here (which almost dissauded me), I found this book one of Satrapi\\'s most magical, perfect creations.  It\\'s quite different than the autobiographical, child-like Persepolis I, though readers of Persepolis II and Embroideries will recognize the general tone and style.  That said, it\\'s a work that takes you by surprise with its directness, honesty, and sheer invention.The book follows the last eight days of Nasser Ali Khan\\'s life, as he decides to resign himself to death after his wife, in an argument, destroys his precious \"tar\"--an Iranian sitar-like instrument.  He is a master musician, renowned throughout the country, and the great love affair of his life (despite one thwarted human one) was with this reciprocating instrument.  Unable to find another tar to requite his passion, he loses all taste for life and its joys, and decides to stay in bed until Azrael, the Angel of Death, comes for his soul.  While waiting, we get a series of flashbacks and flashforwards as he--and others--recount the stories and anecdotes that frame his life.  Reading this book is like listening in on family stories around the dinner table, which by their very nature are fragmentary, interrputed, and from multiple points of view.Though a simple story, the manner of telling it is amazingly complex and mesmerizing.

I am certainly glad I did.  This author has an amazing gift.  I enjoyed the book so much I found myself resenting any intrusion that would keep me from reading.  I adored the characters, both Christian and Maddy.  Maddy is a Quaker and although some may be troubled by the thee-thou language, I found it a charming affect of the heroine.  Her faith was such a large part of her life, yet she married a Duke in part to save him from the horror of a madhouse as he recovers from a stroke.  The desperation this man feels at being trapped in his own body as he struggles is palatable and frightening.  You don't have a heart at all if you are not irresistibly drawn in to the story.  The abuses in the madhouse can be disturbing but nevertheless in context with the story, they serve a purpose.  If you like all hearts and flowers brain candy type romance novels, this is not the book for you.  Yet, if you want a riveting story, unforgettable characters, and an intense hero that will steal your heart immediately, and a heroine that you wish you could embrace, Flowers from the Storm is the book for you.  Christian, although reared with all the haughty arrogance of a Duke, learns a gut wrenching humility as he copes with his affliction and his dependence on his Maddygirl slowly turns into an intense all consuming passion.

      "40000 th row:  {'reviewText': 'Six Good Innings: How One Small Town Became a Little League Giantis a story about little league baseball in Tom\\'s River New Jersey from both the past and the present.  The history of Tom\\'s River little league looms large over the teams of today.  As with most books, there are shortcomings.  But the shortcomings should be put into proper context.  For those willing to read through the slow parts, Mr. Kreidler has produced a good story of the present day team.THE STORYToms River had profound Little League World Series success in the nineties under Coach Gaynor.  That precedent meant that when the TRLL team of 2006 won their sectional and went on to the state championship, the 2007 team was already considered a favorite to return to Williamsport.  Coach Puleo\\'s 2007 team shows promise, but has to overcome high expectations as well as several bad breaks.The first two chapters are meant to give insight into the rivalries between the various teams that have become collectively known as \"Tom\\'s River,\" even though the East teams of the 90s are very different from the Americans featured in the 2007 story.  In that sense, Mr. Kreidler seems to be emphasizing that the perception of \"Tom\\'s River\" as a baseball monolith is a misperception.  He goes to great lengths to show that the high expectations are unrealistic given the luck needed to win in the current playoff format.The story of John Puleo\\'s team from 2006 and 2007 begins to take hold more in chapters three through seven and the epilogue.  Those chapters are shorter, easier to digest and flow much better.  We get to learn the fire and determination of Johnny and the good heart of Chris.  This is the story that many readers probably were hoping would have started with chapter 1.Baseball strategy is only lightly mentioned when it was relevant to the drama of a specific game.  This is more of a human interest story about the players and their families.ESPN is actually key to the story of Little League baseball and its worldwide spotlight.  Till ESPN became a household name, there was no outlet to give Little League baseball such exposure.  Tom\\'s River managed to succeed in the early years of that new coverage.  To criticize Mr. Kreidler for being an ESPN contributor is unfair.  It\\'s akin to criticizing a photographer for having pictures submitted to the Associated Press.  ESPN\\'s coverage is clearly the reason for little league baseball\\'s visibility.Kreidler makes it clear that Toms River\\'s successes were due to good luck and good timing.  No doubt, good players and coaches helped.  But advancing far in the little league tournament essentially adds up to getting the right breaks as well as playing well.THE CRITICISMSI must admit that this book was NOT an easy read for me.  In fact, I found that while I sometimes read quickly, this book took me almost a month to read 10 to 20 pages at a time.  The book starts slow and the early narrative seems to switch between time periods in a disjointed way.  Telling the story in chronological order would have made the key elements easier to communicate and understand.The book also tends to over-document the successes of the past teams to give context to the 2007 team.  The first two chapters approach 100 pages of very dense dialogue and repetitious background stories about the Tom\\'s River teams that put the Jersey Shore town on the world\\'s baseball map.  It feels dry and lends to confusion because of the early jumping of the timeline from present to past.The story also goes off on tangents that are not always very enjoyable reading, such as lengthy explanations of the structures and rules of various tournaments.  I could somewhat accept it but I knew some readers would be alienated.Overall these flaws are minor relative to the book\\'s positives.CONCLUSIONBy the end the book very much redeemed itself.  Many others may not reach that finish line and thus may not get to some of the better sections.  But if you can power through the slow parts, there is actually a really great story here.I would actually recommend that those who already know about the Little League Baseball format and the history of Tom\\'s River baseball might want to read chapters three through seven before chapters one and two.  Those with no basic understanding will just have to power through those dense foundational chapters first.If you love baseball and want to learn about the past and present of Tom\\'s River Little League, this book may be for you.Enjoy!', 'summary': \"Six Good Innings - Tom's River and Little League Baseball Glory\"} \n",

Still grieving over Finn\\'s demise, she is trying to rebuild a structure of normalcy so she can face the day without grief.Unfortunately, the gorgeous Russian commands a high market value, and there are plenty of parties willing to pay.Her location is revealed, and soon the Americans, the Brits, and the Russians are all racing to find her - some to protect her, others for what she can offer them, and others for revenge.Soon she is under the seemingly-affectionate care of Burt, a former CIA genius who now has his own private intelligence company, Cougar.

But it is truly universal in scope when it festers in the mind of a teenage boy on a spaceship that's been hurtling through the galaxy for hundreds of years. Yes, author Beth Revis has a stellar imagination. Her sci-fi canon blasts off with spectacular imagery as she creates an entire world down to the last detail aboard the vessel, Godspeed. In her debut work, Across the Universe what anchors the story through this never-before-seen terrain is the motivations of its lead characters. A guy so desperate to be with the girl of his dreams that nothing will stand in his way, not even a cryonic suspension chamber, and a girl trying to salvage a life she was not meant to have.Our heroine, Amy, is frozen in a capsule before being stored in a compartment on Godspeed along with the immobilized bodies of her parents. The process is cringe-inducing, bordering on barbaric. A tube is shoved down her throat and she is submerged in a tank filled with ultra-frigid preservation fluid. She is literally suffocated to sleep. Her terror as she claws at the confines of her glass prison is palpable in the extreme. What she endures is supposed to be worth the trauma - a reanimation when Godspeed reaches its new planetary destination - in 300 years.However, the architect of this grand design did not count teenage infatuation into the equation. Elder is a young guy destined to rule the inhabitants of the ship. He's in training, but seems like he can never live up to the expectations of the current leader, the appropriately named, Eldest. They are thrown into a tizzy when Amy is mysteriously broken out of her capsule and almost dies. On-board pandemonium ensues.But who are these minions Eldest is lording it over? The worker drones who keep the ship on course. They even have an artificial farming area to grow food. They've been doing this for generations. Yes, generations. They've become mechanized themselves. They're told when to breed, when to eat, when to speak. Those showing signs of an independent streak are placed in the hospital ward and deemed mentally ill. It is certainly not an open, free society.Needless to say, Elder is forcibly attracted to Amy. She is the only girl on Godspeed his age. At first, Amy doesn't reciprocate his feelings to the same degree. She's distraught on being awakened 50 years before her parents. She fears that she will never see them alive again. She doesn't know who to trust. Who woke her up? And why?There are many strange occurrences in this metallic city in the sky. The water system is tainted with medication to keep its inhabitants docile and obedient. Men and women engage in intimate relations in public. The star-studded sky is, for the most part, hidden from view while a false sun separates night from day by an over-sized light bulb. And things aren't exactly going according to plan. Is the ship on course? Is it on track to reach its final destination according to its scheduled time frame?Issued as an on-going series, Across the Universe ends with a shocking betrayal. It will be interesting to see how the established relationships are affected moving forward. Will cataclysmic breaches be overcome? Will new leadership prevail? Will festering wounds be put aside so that all can work together in order to reach a common goal?Overall, human frailty is not limited to the confines of Earth.Kudos, as well, to the design team that crafted the book cover. It is exceptional and conveys the message of the ill-fated love story and its deep space setting in one eye-pleasing image. The full scale of Revis' vision is articulated in this breathtaking, attention-getting package.\", 'summary': 'Human frailty is not limited to the confines of Earth'} \n",

I can\\'t for the life of me remember why I had mentioned it.  Maybe it was because I was reviewing 6 film books that month and the one mentioned really, really impressed me.This book, TIMING FOR ANIMATION, is more of a theoretical than applicable book.  And, as such, it should be viewed in that context.  Having this book for almost 2 years now, and picking it up on random occasions, I\\'ve had a change of heart about it\\'s worth.  But, since this book has been the foundation text for animators for almost 30 years, I felt (and still do feel) that we should have seen more examples of animated films whose success was, at least, in part attributed to this work.  That omission makes it a 4-star and not a 5-star book.Again, thanks to J Fella, for the constructive criticism, it is warmly received and needed.*******  *******  *************TIMING FOR ANIMATION is a newly revised version of one of the film industries revered books on animation since it was first published in 1981.  This second edition is essentially an addendum to the first edition and not an adjustment to the material.*Introduction-- What is this book about and how it should be used?**Sub-topics***Pro\\'s and Con\\'s****Conclusion*Timing For Animation is not exactly a thematic book on animation.  It is a sub-topic.  Timing For Animation is essentially a philosophical discussion about the execution of movement for any and all scenes within a project.  You will not find within this book (nor should you expect) broad-based lessons on how to create animation or technical aspects of filmmaking.Timing For Animation is used to determine the fluidity or as the authors stated, \"what gives meaning to the movement.\"  Directors, animators (and, by necessity, the auditing dept.) plan out scenes television program, commercial and feature film with these theories in mind.  This sub-topic provides answers to questions like how fast or how slow will the execution of certain gestures affect the overall vision of the storyteller(s).  When to move and when not to move?  Where and when to insert gestures?  How does the environment (natural elements) react to given situation?**Also, there are slightly different rules for executing a scene (\"mise-en-scene\") for television work, commercial advertisement and feature-film projects.  These differences are discussed within.Some of the sub-topics are as follows:What is good timing?How is timing supposed to affect a moment in the film?Timing and the use of storyboardsTiming for television and Timing for filmTiming for actor-based programs, \"motion capture.\"Movement and caricatureCause and EffectObjects thrown through the airThe effects of friction, air resistance and waterTiming to suggest weightSynchronization for speech***Pro\\'s and Con\\'sPro\\'s+ Introduction by John Lassater, head of Pixar, about the importance of \"timing\" in animation is very important.+ Until recently, it was the only book that dealt specifically with the subtext of animation.  The other is, now, Elemental Magic (5-stars).+ Revised version details how timing is used on the internet, motion graphics and digital animation.+ Essential topic-discussion for directorial, artistic and budgeting considerations in the pre-  planning stages.+ Hundreds of beautiful animations, makes this an aesthetically attractive book on its ownCon\\'s- Relatively thin book with sparse examples and barely half a page of explanatory notes per subject- No cd-rom with supplementary material (this should be par for the course with such texts)- Some chapters could have been condensed; others could have been expounded more thoroughly.**** Timing For Animation is an important book that addresses the critical issue of the importance of fluidity in a scene.  Thirty (30) years ago it was considered the only authority on the subject in print, however, this newly revised version has little to offer that than the previous version.I\\'m recommending this book as an addendum to one\\'s animation book collection.

This is a book about the dysfunctional Lambert family with a capital \"D\" made up of the parents, Enid and Al in their twilight years, and their three grown children, Gary, Chip and Denise.  None of the characters are likable.  I can identify with parts of each of them, but I ultimately cannot root for any of them.  The frustration that goes along with this fact is what drove so many of our group away from this book.  I realize that many books deal with families in crisis.  This is a good conflict for a book and most modern fiction seems to deal with these issues on some level.  That said, I have a need to see something heroic about the characters I\\'m spending so much time getting to know.  The Lambert\\'s are so self-involved that they are consistently damaging those closest to them.  The title of the book hints at some of the characters trying to make a correction or change in their behavior.  This was the redemption that I was waiting for, but none of the characters save Chip truly deliver on this promise (and even Chip\\'s change is tainted by another motive).  The Corrections that the book refers to are about the families\\' failed efforts at change, not their success.  Franzen is drawn to this self-interest in each of these characters but has little room for heroism.  Maybe this is as it should be.As for what is good about the book, there is no denying that the writing is fabulous.  The characters are completely believable.  Franzen inhabits each of the five characters fully and with such care that I wondered sometimes if there were five different authors.  Patterns in behavior are carefully flushed out, why one character sides with one sibling or parent against another is developed throughout the book.  On top of all this family intimacy, Franzen also develops a nice snapshot of life in the 90s that touches on the stock market bubble, the rise and fall of former Soviet satellite nations, corporate greed and campus politics.  I can easily see why so many people heralded his book as one of the best of the year.

The story revolves around a futuristic lunar society rebelling against an oppressive and exploitive Terran government.The book does two things extremely well, which pretty much carry it through its medium length.  First off, it pays attention to the details and Heinlein was extremely imaginative when it came to the particulars of his future lunar society.  Everything from social norms, to physics to human physiological details were well thought out and executed.  Out of all the science fiction I\\'ve read, this book delves into the details of lunar life in a more satisfying and complete way then anything else I\\'ve come across.

The computer evolves and is the one of the catalysts behind the lunar revolution.  Heinlein brings up thought provoking issues about computers place in society, and this was long before the home computer revolution.My biggest problem with the book was the first person writing style incorporated by Heinlein.  Often confusing, the Russian stream of conscience (complete with accent) was a major misfire.  Important and insignificant events come and go with little impunity and it took a good third of the novel to get used to it.  For me it really kept the novel from achieving that \"wow\" factor despite its originality.This book was nominated for a Hugo award in 1966 AND 1967 (winning the latter) and a Nebula in 1967.

As such, it is very entertaining and not much heavy mental lifting is required.  Unfortunately, there is also not much to be learned.  The Irish did not save civilization (presumably Western) just like the Scots did not invent the modern world. (The subject of another pretentiously titled book I just reviewed.)  Thomas Cahill, director of religious publishing at Doubleday, writes in the lyrical and hyperbolic Irish tradition, which is very endearing, but not very informative.The story of the \"Dark Ages\" is fairly well-known.  It begins with the fall of the Roman Empire.  Cahill\\'s section on the decline of Rome is very good.  His description of how the empire expanded too rapidly for its rulers to govern is a classic.  Rome - and Europe - falls to Alaric and the Visigoths in the 5th century and as a result there are no longer any books, any centers of learning, any scribes, nor any high culture in general.  The author\\'s retelling of these events is very vivid and insightful.Cahill\\'s popularization begins with the story of a Celtic shepard boy named Patricius.  The young man experiences the fall of Rome and goes through a spiritual conversion, and he then decides to embark on a religious mission to Ireland to convert the wild and barbaric pagans.  Patricius - now St. Patrick - became, according to Cahill, the first European missionary.  In Ireland, Patrick created a Christian following that was independent of the European Christian body.  Patrick\\'s Christianity was attractive to the Irish since it was an uplifting and secure-feeling alternative to the dark and fearful world which was Medieval Ireland.  Countless monasteries were established in which monks worked quietly transcribing the wisdom of the ancient world.  The most notable achievement of this era was \"The Book of Kells;\" it was the apex of Western calligraphy and illuminated manuscripts. (An sample is given in this volume.)And finally, claims Cahill, these monks became missionaries and established monasteries and centers of learning throughout continental Europe; in short, they \"refounded European civilization.\"  It\\'s a great story, but the evidence is pretty thin.I must admit I heard this story before, from my high school history teacher about 35 years ago. (The history teacher\\'s surname was Carney - no surprise there.)  What Cahill - and my old history teacher - left out was that the Byzantium world also inherited the learning of the ancients.

Emotional. Heart-warming.Suzanne: I Love WrathAnnie: LONG LIVE THE KING (Yeah yeah, I cheated.)Did reality of The King live up to the hype?Angela: Yes! He certainly proved his worth and then some. It&#8217;s not a surprise who the people will pick.Francesca: It certainly did, and in a way that I was not expecting.  But Ward is so great at that.  This book was magical.Suzanne: For me&#8230;yes it did, in fact it exceeded my expectations! I wasn&#8217;t sure what another look at Wrath and Beth was going to entail, would it just be a retelling of Dark Lover? Or them bickering over phantom problems? But it turned out to be much more intense than that and it made me fall in love again, not just with Wrath and Beth, but with the whole Brotherhood.Annie: To be honest, I went into this book trying not to expect anything. I just wanted to be there for the ride. But Ward did something that not a lot of authors can do. She was able to take a couple who already had their HEA and give them something more. Something that not only added to the series as a whole, but also created some development in the character&#8217;s lives as well. Ward writes some of the most heartwrenching and touching moments you&#8217;ll ever read in romantic fiction.How well does this fit in with the rest of the series?Angela: I think with the turn of events as far as the throne goes, there will be a big shift in how this world interacts with each other. But Ward will have to bring on a big conflict, perhaps in the form of the Virgin Scribe or the Omega or even Lash.Francesca: It&#8217;s crazy that I&#8217;m saying this, but this would&#8217;ve been a great ending to the series if just some loose ends were tied.  I would&#8217;ve been satisfied with where this ended.  Obviously the greedy reader in me wants more and I&#8217;m so happy that we will get more.  But this book touched on most of our favorite characters, gave glimpses of the lives of many.  And it certainly took their world by the balls.  THE KING is definitely one of Ward&#8217;s best books as of late, I think, because she wasn&#8217;t afraid to go in a different direction.  To make some major changes in the world.  I&#8217;m so excited to see what&#8217;s to come.Suzanne: I thought this fitted in really well, and not just fit in, but really stood out as one of the better books in the series. It ties up some story threads, whilst continuing others and open up whole new ones, keeping the series fresh, when I believe around Tohr&#8217;s book, it was feeling a little stale.Annie: Well, the title doesn&#8217;t fit in at all. But despite my initial freak out, I found that THE KING really showcased the &#8220;bigger picture&#8221; of the BDB world. We see the glymera and their actions towards Wrath, we see Assail and Trez and iAm getting larger roles in the book. Xcor is stepping aside onto another path that I didn&#8217;t think we&#8217;d see from him, but together, it creates for a story that has its twists and turns while still keeping the several threads of romances going strong with each of the pages in this book. How THE KING is written sticks to Ward&#8217;s signature style so there&#8217;s much to love there.There were different storylines and POVs in The King, which was your favourite, which was your least?Angela: Well, Xcor and Trez spiked my interest equally. Both men are not so innocent in every sense of the word and they will be paired up with women who are completely opposite of their very being. I can&#8217;t wait to see them fall to their knees. But Assail is my fave. He is one hot, very hot hero.Francesca: Obviously my favorite was Wrath and Beth, but aside from the main couple there are many I enjoyed John Matthew because I&#8217;m always a greedy whore for him, Saxton &#8211; because he&#8217;s a male of worth and I just need a full book about him and his HEA, and surprisingly iAm!  I cannot wait to see more of iAm!  My least favorite was Trez.  If his storyline would&#8217;ve been wrapped up nicely in this book I would&#8217;ve been satisfied.  I really have no interest in reading more about him.Suzanne: I know there are some people who don&#8217;t like the different story lines that weave through the books and instead wants it all concentrated on the main couple. But I am not one of those people. I thought the balance of the Wrath and Beth vs the other characters was perfect, there was plenty of the main couple, we didn&#8217;t need to spend 90% of the book with them, especially when there were other interesting things happening. The characters story line I thought I would find tedious was Assail and Sola&#8217;s, as I hadn&#8217;t warmed up to Assail very much&#8230;I should have known that Ward would make me do a 180 and I instead found myself looking forward to their POVs. But the POV I found myself loving the most (apart from Wrath and Beth) was Trez and iAm, especially iAm, I canont wait to see what happens with them!Annie: Obviously Wrath and Beth were my favorite to read about. Their scenes together are so emotional that it&#8217;s hard to stay detached from their characters. You definitely feel every ounce of emotion Ward puts in her books. I enjoyed Trez and iAm a lot as well. So by process of elimination, I&#8217;ll say that Sola and Assail were my least favorite. I do like Assail, but while I admire Sola&#8217;s courage and actions, there&#8217;s still a lot of questions surrounding her and her purpose in the series. Until I know more, I can take or leave Sola.Wrath and Beth&#8230;what are you&#8217;re thoughts on them after this book?Angela: I think we will continue to see their progress after this.  There is life after happy-ever-after, after all.  Just like Z with his girls, life is always a work in progress.Francesca: I have many thoughts.  First Wrath was a major DICK!  I was so pissed at him for a while because I think he could&#8217;ve handled some things better.  But ultimately, I fell in love with him in a way that I didn&#8217;t think would happen.  Then Beth.  She started off annoying me a bit with her moods.  But once she took control, she showed me a new side of herself.  I can honestly say I ended this book LOVING Beth.  She&#8217;s strong, she took care of her man and what needed to be done.  She fought for her man.  And the two of them together?  Well, just refer to the sentence a bit back where it says I&#8217;m in love.  Yeah, they were beautiful together.  Beautiful!Suzanne: I have always had a crazy obsessive love for Wrath, which has now been tripled, but I now have a little girl crush on Beth. Simply put she was awesome, she had an inner strength and compassion that I couldn&#8217;t help but admire. And together, they were fantastic.Annie:  IN. LOVE.  Really, could you ask for a more perfect ending than that?  I cheered, I cried, I panicked and I laughed my freaking ass off too. Dark Lover is my most reread book of all time, but I&#8217;m thinking with some time, THE KING will also have many rereads in the future.In general, love or hate this book?Angela: I loved this book. Wrath is and will always be my TOP FAVOURITE HERO. I don&#8217;t think J. R. Ward could ever do wrong when it comes to THE KING.Francesca: LOVE!  Love, love love.  And the main reason why?  This book breathes new life into the series.  It brings a new love for all the characters.  It&#8217;ll be the book that will make you fall in love ALL OVER AGAIN with your favorites, and the ones you didn&#8217;t think were that special.  It showed me why I love Ward&#8217;s writing, and how it&#8217;s the simple scenes and interactions, a small dialogue maybe, that have such impact on your feelings.Suzanne: Love, love, love. I think this is one of the best books to come out the series, although it may not have the page devotion to the hot &#8216;n steamy like the previous books, what it has is a an intense and emotional love story, as well as the beginnings of a few others. It also has some interesting plot development and I can&#8217;t wait to see where the story will go from here. And all told in the unique and urban-poetic voice of J.R.Ward.Annie: I want to caress my book. Does that suffice as an answer?Who do you think will be next in the series?Angela: I&#8217;m hoping it will be Assail but I have a feeling it will be Xcor. I think he has very strict ties to what happens next to the Brotherhood.Francesca: Xcor and Layla.  For me, that&#8217;s the only choice.  The only one I want to accept.Suzanne: I think either, Trez and Selena or Assail and Sola. I would love it to be Layla and Xcor or iAm and whatever lucky female he shacks up with, but I don&#8217;t think their stories are quite as well set up yet as Trez and Assail.Annie: I know Francesca and Angela said Xcor. Suz is going for Trez or Assail, but I&#8217;m gonna go for a big, big stretch here and just say Lassiter. Because who honestly wouldn&#8217;t more of that Elvis scene? It was definitely the best part of the book!', 'summary': 'Ward writes some of the most heartwrenching and touching moments you&#8217;ll ever read in romantic fiction.'} \n",

Everything is explained in lucid details including the necessary basic financial mathematics.You have to know how much money you need at a fixed time some years into the future (e.g. saving 150000$ for the college in 17 years), you need to have a sufficient regular income to do the necessary savings and finally you need an estimate about the performance of the stock market in the coming years (and the inflation and maybe some more numbers). The book helps you to develop a stock investment plan with a required accumulated stock value at every month or quarter. If the stocks actual value is less than required buy more stocks. If it is more than required sell a sufficient amount. The excess money is parked in the money market until needed for the savings plan. You get a mechanical system that leads to buying at low prices and selling at high prices. A contrarian investment scheme.The interesting fact is that it worked on historical data and simulated historical data of the US stock market better than an efficient market would naively suggest. It is not proved but probably it would work on any prosperous and judicial save stock market.

Not only does he make ridiculous comparisons of ancient Legion officers to contemporary officer titles but allot of his history is simply wrong or not covered in it's appropriate entirety which is no doubt a short-coming due to the length of the book.

John seemed to be someone that just could not be happy in his own skin, he did not see himself as a worthy human being who deserved to be happy, but instead someone who did not deserve his fame, or did not feel he was respected in the ways he thought he should be, he was constantly trying to prove himself. John was selfish, yes, he would binge for weeks on drugs, parties, and the fast life looking to fill that void regardless of who it hurt.

I feel sorry for John and wish that he would of been given the help he was crying out to receive.

Each time that I have seen James Cameron's Titanic, it has been from a different perspective.The first time was from a comparative approach to Jean Negulesco's version which I saw at the movies in 1953.  My  summary was that Cameron's Titanic was to a degree far fetched, whereas  Negulesco's version was more realistic because of the time Mr.Negulesco  directed this particular film.  In 1953, it was 41 years after the sinking  of the Titanic occurred, and some of the survivors, their family, relatives  or friends might have been alive, and available to be interviewed for  research that went into the making of this great film.  Cameron might have  directed the 1997 film to accommodate the needs of a present day  audience;  young people seeking to be entertained with lots of adventure, romance,  sex, crass, and the present day god, materialism.The second time I went  to see Titanic was from an impartial perspective.  Taking into  consideration the story line, special effects, and acting performances of  DiCaprio and Winslet, there were shades of Hollywoodism, and even brighter  shades of Sci-Fi.By the time that I saw Cameron's film for the third  time, I was able to flesh out that there was something for the young as  well as the old, and something for the past as well as the present.  For  the young, they were able to enjoy Titanic because the history was only  secondary, as adventure, romance, sex and materialism were primary.  For  the older generation like myself, oh yes, I could fully cherish the special  effects.  At the opening scene of the ocean, it had the same impact as it  did when I saw the 1953 movie, fear, trembling, and a tremendous respect  for the ocean.  I feel as though I can identify with the Titanic, having  sailed on the Cunard ships,the M.V.Georgic, and the RMS Queen Mary. Oh yes,  I was a young girl when I sailed on the Queen Mary, and I so recall with  fondness and love the romance that I had with one of the officers on the  return to New York on the Queen Mary.  Take it from one who has been there,  there is nothing more romantic than having romance on board a ship, there  is you, that other special person and that powerful ocean. I feel somewhat  connected to the Titanic also, because I knew two survivors myself.  One  was my great uncle, a successful businessman who tried to get on board the  Titanic only to be turned away at the gangplank in Southampton, and the  other person, a neighbor of mine who might have sailed on the Titanic if  the girl he loved had turned down his marriage proposal in London only two  weeks earlier.  These late gentleman were survivors of the Titanic, not  direct, but indirect, but survivors.  There was one survivor, Mary Glynn  from the same village my mother came from in Ireland, and the other lady  did not survive, Irene Corbett, an acquaintance of my late father's family.  Both those names can be found on the list of passengers.The end scene  was extremely well handled.  It was powerful.  For the old lady Rose, the  end scene  might have been a dream or reality, but an allegory that the  most valuable gem was meaningless next to everlasting feelings. And then we  see the old lady Rose sleeping happily and peacefully dreaming of the young  Rose being joined by those from the Titanic who had gone before her, and  Jack in a beaufitul and joyful reunion.  That scene was very special for  the older generation because there was something in for all of us, and  especially as we are more accepting of the inevitable, which Mr. Cameron's  handling of it made us all believe that it can be happy.In summation, I  preferred Negulesco's Titanic than Cameron's, but, yes, the present version  of Titanic was worthwhile, and oh yes, I would see it again and again.\", 'summary': 'Something for the young and old and for the past and present'} \n",

First, MacDonald pulled me into a new land that has enough familiar surroundings to keep me from losing my bearings, but enough new elements to keep me wanting to see what's behind the next tree.  In fact, the setting is a primary component of this book.  There are active creatures who live in flowers kind of like snails live in shells.  There are sinister trees.  There are statues that are full of life if you catch them at the right moment.  MacDonald crafts a fresh world through words - a world my eyes have never seen, yet a world my brain can see when I feed it MacDonald's descriptions.Second, the main character wades through uncertainty, danger, and a few mistakes that have irrevocable consequences.  Yet through it all, MacDonald doesn't throw patronizing explanations for every scene and activity and character.  I get to come up with my own interpretations.  What's the point about the knight whose armor shines more brightly as the story progresses?  What's the point about the unwelcome and malicious shadow?  What's the point about the trek into the dark, goblin-infested cavern, where vision is limited to a few feet in each direction?

Bogle suppose to lift Blacks up not put them down.Here's a long but informative review!Naturally since Bogle is the only one writing about early Black film stars people believe everything he says. He plays it safe by always talking about the same ole' stars that he talked about in his last books. Never does he introduce the public to unsung talents we never heard of. He spends most of the time talking about how mulatto, how light or how dark such and such is and how such and such couldn't do this or that because of this or that. When whites write on their stars they don't write about how blonde, how brunette or how red head someone was and how Irish or Italian one looked. Which proves how stuck on skin color Blacks really are! Why do Blacks feel they always have to spend time talking about race instead of giving these stars their recognition and due, forgetting how they look and telling of their life and versatile careers, who they really were, where they come from, making one reading feel like they knew the person all their lives, make one feel the happiness and sadness.Bogle spends more time on what they didn't do then what they did do. Which is sad, the public is missing out on a lot. So again, do for yourself the research and don't' depend on others all the time.Bogle loves talking about how white Fredi Washington looked instead of writing about her extensive, incredible career, she done more in her life then most of us could dream about it, she didn't let others prejudices hold her back. She was no tragic mulatto, another stupid name, minus well call Stepin Fetchit a tragic ni**er which he wasn't, he was the first black millionaire and no more of a stereotype then Black pimps, gangsters of today who are getting rich off of it like Step got rich off of his stereotype. Fredi will be the first to say she had a great life and career. She wasn't sad or confused but a strong black woman. Bogle is no better than a white writer who puts down a black but thinks its okay to coin a book Toms, Coons, Mulattoes, Mammies and Bucks because he's black, I'm sure if a white titled a book that we be yelling racism, don't Black talents deserve a better title?Bogle also plays it safe by always talking about Lena Horne and Dorothy Dandridge, never telling the stories and never giving recognition to other black actresses like Nina Mae McKinney, Mildred Washington, Theresa Harris, Fredi Washington, Edna Mae Harris, Florence O'Brien, Louise Franklin, Daisy Bufford, Jeni LeGon Evelyn Preer, Suzette Harbin, Hilda Simms, Francine Everett, Shirley Haven and countless of others who had a chance to display their talents on the screen in Hollywood and helped fight discrimination and  help in the enhancement and betterment of blacks on screen but he gives all the credit to Horne and Dandridge, who didn't do as much as others if you want to get down to the truth, but I'm glad he don't talk about them in a way because he'll butcher up their life stories, I'll give them their due though. Many aren't remembered because maybe they didn't do as much, who cares about who has done more, were suppose to be remembering them for accomplishments and talents, right? White film historians sure remember all their stars, little or big. Someone like Louise Brooks, considered a early Hollywood icon is highly regarded as a great actress despite she only had a few good films and wasnt a big movie star. The woman is more remembered for one good film and a bobbed hairstyle but white historians will make sure you know her, her achievements and what she DID DO for the film industry.  Why can't Bogle be like that instead of criticizing everyone and judging them by white people's standards of what success and beauty is? I guess it's true that you gotta work twice as hard as whites to be someone in this world, whites can be remembered for little things, few successes, Blacks gotta have many successes to get rememberance and recognition even for other Blacks to remember them. Bogle is one of the few black film historians, you would think he would write more positively of blacks in Hollywood but he treats many worse then whites treated them when they were alive. Bogle never mentions Willie Covan and Marie Bryant (and appeared in movies also and was a good friend of Lena Horne's too) who choreograhed many white stars, they were behind the scenes but contributed to Hollywood. He suppose to be giving credit not taking away. Either Bogle is too lazy or likes to show favoritism because he sure won't tell other unsung talents stories. If he does he clutter it up with talking about their looks especially if he doesn't know how to write about them. Bogle knows nothing about the great career of Nina Mae McKinney, the first movie star of Hollywood and Europe, who done more films then any other black actress of her time, the first to appear on many magazines, she had so many achievements, yet he gives her one little page, if you don't know about a person, I rather you not write about them at all then to write lies. He never talks about the Black Cinema independent movie stars or the industry who was apart of American cinema, I guess their too hard for him to research, so he takes the easy path in writing about stars he already wrote about a million times. He never writes about Ethel Moses, Francine Everett, Dorothy Van Engle, Edna Mae Harris, Margaret Whitten, Tomiwitta Moore, Bee Freeman, Lorenzo Tucker, Monte Hawley, Ralph Cooper (created the first black studio in Hollywood), Oscar Micheaux, Spencer Williams and countless other black movie stars who appeared in films for blacks made by blacks in the 30's and 40's, I guess that's too mediocre for him but they done more for the enhancement of Blacks in movies by creating their own images, own roles, own portrayals, playing people from all walks of life unlike ones in Hollywood who were stuck playing the same types of roles and being the same images he always complaining about well I feel give due to ones who at least tried to do for themselves and become what they wanted but see they weren't cross-overs so their looked at as non-important by some which kind of dictated by whites who we should remembered and who's important. It's hard researching Black Cinema stars but boy it's worth it plus studying them, watching them perform gives you a good idea of who they were even if you can't find info on them. I still find the time to give them due and I'm no professional or anything but Bogle is a high class guy who only likes to write about Hollywood and his favorite gals Horne and Dandridge.Ive done more research on unsung, forgotten stars then he has and it has been pleasurable teaching others on the net about blacks who contributed to stage and screen, stars who were just as important as Dandridge and Horne. I'm glad there are other people who are taking it upon themselves to tell the true stories of many unsung black legends and don't write in the same fashion as Bogle. Anyone who is hung up on skin color and don't want to think outside the box and like to hear the same stories then Bogle is for you but someone like me who researched many early black stars of stage and screen on my own and found out the real deal, found how they really were, found how they were really looked at, and found the true stories wouldn't appreciate Bogle's work much. I've talked with some legendary Blacks of the early years, some of their relatives also and they gave a completely different view then how Bogle describes them which shows he just goes by hearsay and documents and don't do accurate interviewing and researching.I would think Bogle would spend more time on talking about the beauty of  black women from dark to light and  their wonderful achievements to the world.  Black women are quite unique but instead Bogle tells the  story of black women from white people's perspective it seems, he tells how black women were looked at from whites perspective not from a true black person's perspective that has pride for his race, maybe Bogle has a white person's way of thinking who is partial.

Again, he makes it seem like such and such suffered because she was mulatto, light or dark, come on man, if she had a tragic life it was her own fault if she suffered. He makes it seem like color and race was the problem for everything which is false, actually many of these women profited from the race sometimes and plus women in general face discrimination, no matter what race or color. Don't you think these women went through enough being judged by skin tone or looks, they wished in their life for being to judge their talent, at least give them that now, Bogle doesn't. Who isn't discriminated against in this world? Bogle makes it look like Black is a curse when these female performers change the world and introduce the world to their greatness and the greatness of the race. He loves talking about whether someone should of passed for white or not like when he's talking about the great Fredi Washington. He misses out on showcasing  other great talents like Valaida Snow, Blanche Calloway, Una Mae Carlisle, Eunice Wilson, Adelaide  Hall and  others but that's okay because they have  been written  beautifully about by other writers. Well, many are dead so they cant stick up for themselves and Bogle takes advantage of that, he hasn't even interviewed or actually talked to ones who he writes about, he just goes by hearsay. Have your favorites but when you write a book, you can't show favoritism which he does all through which hurts others who has a story to tell but he only give honor to his faves. It seems no black can make him happy, he always has something to criticize. In his words every Black woman is a tragic, confused mulatto and every black man is a coon, or some other stereotype, he wouldn't say that to the young black guys or gals in entertainment today though, he takes advantage of the dead who can't stick  up for themselves.There is a website on unsung black talents of stage and screen, you all will enjoy.[...]\", 'summary': 'Bogle is the mole!

While Shattering the Myths of Darwinism focused on such particular sciences as geology and evolutionary biology, Alternative Science focuses on science in general.The book Alternative Science is NOT an attack on science. On the contrary, Richard Milton actually has great respect for science and recognises the scientific method as the only proper way of ascertaining what is and what isn\\'t true. The book says nothing against science, but rather against the attitude of certain scientists who only pay lip service to the scientific method and expect everyone to accept their opinions as absolute facts.Milton shows how many old concepts that were attacked by the scientific community later turned out to be quite true. These include such things as meteorites, X-rays, powered flight, television, space travel and much much more. The interesting thing is that these concepts were rejected more because they didn\\'t fit with established dogma rather than because the evidence was against them. Often they were supported by loads of evidence. The Wright brothers\\' first flight, for instance, was an event backed up by many pieces of evidence including photographs of the brothers flying. Yet despite this, it took five years before their flights became an officially accepted fact, and that was only because they managed to do a flight demonstration before an enormous crowd.Richard Milton shows how the same can apply to many concepts today. There exists plenty of hard experimental evidence for such things as cold fusion, psychokinesis, bioenergy, alternative medicine and many other \"alternative science\" concepts. Yet much of the scientific community ignores this evidence and rejects all \"alternative science\" concepts, often without even bothering to look into it.Milton shows how there appear to exist certain mindsets within the scientific community, where there are a number of ideologies that are uncritically accepted when the opinions of the majority hold them. This is not scientific. Science is supposed to be about reviewing all available and seeing where it leads. If it leads to conclusions radically different from the current orthodoxy then we must be willing to accept changing said orthodoxy.Of particular interest is when Milton points out how subjective terms like \"rational\" are. What seemed rational to many primitive societies does not seem rational today, and similarly many things we consider rational today may be in fact be quite wrong.Alternative Science is a book that gives one a lot to think about. One can only hope that the scientific community can develop some more sense in the future.', 'summary': 'A book that proves there is something wrong with the scientific community'} \n",

But, when I found out that Rachael was giving away copies of the book in e-book form to bloggers, I couldn\\'t resist the indulgence. The following is my review of Amaranth by Rachael Wade, the first installment in the Resistance Trilogy.Can You Judge a Book by its Cover?Okay, so there are plenty of yucky book covers out there that house good reads but Amaranth has anything but a yucky cover - very beautifully designed. I also really liked how the cover art tied into the book itself. Not a lot of books do this. The same outfit worn by the main character, Camilla Hart, on the cover is also mentioned and worn inside the book. Very great tie-in!Character DevelopmentLately, I have noticed a huge flood of vampire/fantasy/angel/demon romance books on the market. I have bought a few, read a few and have, outside of on series, been rather disappointed. Poor character development has become quite common in this genre - one-dimensional characters that have no motive, no depth and are sometimes downright annoying.Not the case with Amaranth. Character development was very solid. Author Rachael Wade took you on an emotional journey. By the end of the book, I was completely engrossed in each of the main characters and had a pretty good glimpse of some of the minor characters.Camilla Hart, especially, came to life for me. I could feel her fears, her desires and her doubts. I could see depth in them, feeling like I knew them, understood their inner struggles and inner desires just enough to make them seem alive.Story LineI could envision moments in the book - see them as if they were really happening. It was like reading one of those \"true story\" books, only better. The fantasy added that extra touch of excitement and surreal indulgence that most fantasy readers are highly addicted to.Some readers may be taken aback by the story line in Amaranth. If you\\'re not into engaging books, then you probably won\\'t enjoy Amaranth. You have to take your time here and there - I believe it is part of the reason that the characters are so well developed - because Rachael makes you slow down a little to experience the book. You taste, see, hear and feel the sights, people and places. In my opinion, this has become a sad rarity in the vampire/fantasy fiction genre. The absence of it in many of my recent reads made Amaranth a refreshing experience.While Rachael does slow you down so you can better experience the world of Amaranth, it does not drag on. There are ebbs and flows, crescendos and decrescendos in the book. The way Amaranth moves throughout the story line reminds me of classical music. Beautifully moving, taking the reader gracefully through every moment, speeding up when the excitement peaks but slowing down so you can indulge.OriginalityAmaranth was not your typical vampire romance book. Author Rachael Wade really made this genre her own, reminding me of a time that vampire romance books didn\\'t saturate the shelves of every book store. No copycatting found here - very satisfying since I read a lot of vampire fiction.The Bad News?Probably the only negative I noticed about Amaranth was the end hook. Author Rachael Wade left off in a place where the story peaks, leaving you hungry for more. This, of course, is how trilogy books are supposed to end...the \"to be continued,\" so to speak. Sadly, however, I am one of those really impatient readers. I want the next book immediately accessible to me so that I can keep reading! I found this especially true with Amaranth. Alas, I suppose I will just have to wait for the next installment...impatiently.', 'summary': 'Excellent, Unique, Engaging - Definitely a MUST Read for Vamp Romance Lovers'} \n",

In this time of apocalyptic despair, love is put to the test. One woman with mysterious healing power guides eight children to safety. Charismatic Arthur offers her a haven. Slowly Emma falls for him. But at the moment of their sweetest love, his devastating secret is revealed, and they are lost to each other.My ThoughtsAs far as the genre goes this particular offering of a post apocalyptic dystopian was one that appealed to me because of the mystical side to the storyline. The fact that survivors had changed in ways that defied man&#8217;s parameters of &#8220;normal&#8221; was very unique and also gave the story a tone that was beyond most of the other books that I have enjoyed in this genre.Needless to say there is still brutal reality that life as we know it will never be the same, however the fact that there are still people alive with the knowledge and the skills to rebuild the world anew gives the reader hope.With an edgy strong cast of supporting as well as main characters along with some very action packed scenes that play off the survivors strengths and magnify some of their weaknesses this is a book that swept me along easily even when I did not agree with some of Emma&#8217;s decisions. The actual relationship of mutual respect and caring that develops between she and Arthur is one that gives depth to what otherwise is a very practical arrangement. Hopefully the secrets that these two are keeping from one another do not end up costing them more than they have already lost but you will have to read the story to find out for yourself.By the end of Fallen I was very vested in the outcome and judging by the ending the next book, Bk #2 Cold Light which I am now reading, is going to have some major shocks in store for more then just Arthur and Haywood. This was a good beginning to a new kind of dystopian trilogy, one that explores boundaries not touched on yet by others that I have read.

Roberts\\'s suggestions are both timely and relevant.  Texas pastor Bob Roberts Jr. attributes his heart change to being challenged by a Saudi Arabian prince to do the impossible; to somehow bring Muslims and Christians together in the buckle of the Bible belt. That was the start of something new for his congregation; as its members began hosting an event drawing Christians and Muslims. A frequent speaker on this subject, Roberts has written Bold as Love: What Can Happen When We See People the Way God Does, with the aim of helping Christians live out their faith among people of all faiths.\"Globalization\", Roberts says, \"has changed American neighborhoods, giving Christians close-at-hand opportunities to demonstrate the gospel to people from all over the world.\" He urges Christians to be honest about their beliefs, not to dilute them, and to begin by loving people and building relationships. He believes this requires bold love, not \"shy faith,\" which must focus on serving God and following His commands, even taking the first step. Further, he has found that nothing builds relationships like serving side-by-side with people who practice a different faith.Today\\'s unprecedented mass migration has resulted in diverse, powerful world religions living next door to one another. Picking our faith passively, or throwing our hands in the air, is not an option. We must speak frankly, but lovingly, with all religions in today\\'s compact world.Roberts takes a good amount of time to describe his term \"multifaith,\" which reflects his real goal: people who passionately believe their own faith, and passionately want to know their neighbors as real people; which is different from \"interfaith\" that tries to meld all beliefs into one. Distinguishing between \"interfaith\" and \"multifaith,\" Roberts doesn\\'t advocate the concept that \"all paths lead to God.\" Interfaith gatherings tend to \"ignore core truth.\"  Roberts says multifaith efforts acknowledge \"we have fundamental differences, but the best of our faiths teach us we should get along.\"Although I agree with what Roberts says is needed, this book does give one much to think about. I believe there is a fine line to walk with others and still be salt and light to the world. It is commendable to work for \"peace on earth\" I am concerned that we will only preach a social gospel (let\\'s just be friends) and leave out the eternal gospel. The mission of the Church should be to preach the Gospel of the death, burial and the resurrection of Jesus, so that people on their way to hell under the judgment of God for sin can turn to a Merciful God and be saved.

However the conclusion of the book, that the ancient megaliths tell a story about a world wide system of surveying and measurement well in effect in 3000 BC, will turn the world of scholarship upside down.  While it is a pioneering work, there is more than enough information here to prove the authors basic premise that the megalithic sites, all over the world, represent a map of the sky on the ground.Implications in this book for historians include granting ancient peoples much more credibility for understanding our place in the solar system, movements of people and ideas in the ancient world, the origin of scientific methods and an uncanny knowledge of these ideas around the world.When I was growing up I always heard that our human cognitive abilities were developed in part from observing the sun, moon and stars.  This book begins to develop the meaning of that statement by showing that the depth of understanding of the relationship of the sky to terrestrial geography was profound in the human species for a very long time.  It is a shame that most historians and archeologists have forgotten or never knew basic astronomy and its relationship with the reality structure of ancient people.  This book begins to mend this problem.A bonus with the book is the linguistic comparison of the names of the constellations, stars, megalithic sites and local town names with the local native language, and other languages including Latvian.  This analysis supports the theory that the ancients were aware of precession, the pole of the ecliptic and other astronomical facts that historians are reluctant to admit.The dating of the monuments by analyzing carvings on the stones to represent moments where solstices and other astronomical events occured in the past is revolutionary.

Fearghus a dragon was nearby watching.  When she was wounded and close to dying, he kills the soldiers with fire and takes her back to his cave to heal.  They become close.

For readers who want an interesting page-turning story about a 21 year old intern who falls in love with the president, then this is an exciting and well done novel.  The novel is about infatuation, friendship, trust, love, betrayal, and the mistakes me make along the way.  It is about the lengths we would go to be with those we love and the relationships we mistake for love that may or may not be.Jamie comes from a functionally dysfunctional family of interesting characters.  She has a few childhood friends she has known forever and makes some close new friends when she starts her job as an intern in the white house.  Things quickly get complicated and before long she&#8217;s started an illicit liaison with the most powerful man in the world.  When opposing parties seek to impeach the president, Jamie&#8217;s world will be flipped upside down.This novel was reminiscent of a certain well known scandal during the Clinton administration.  While the affair was wrong on many levels, I could not help but feel for Jamie and despite the circumstances, I still found her to be a likable character.  Part of what makes Jamie a successful character was the well done narration.  Emily Sutton-Smith is a very believable &#8220;Jamie&#8221;.

Lycans are an obvious symbol for terrorists and terrorism and race and racism and a bunch of other -isms you can probably work out for yourself.  This correlation is so obvious that it's hardly worth mentioning, but the ways the obvious drives the story are at the core of the book's flaws and that's why I mention it.About two-thirds of Red Moon is a decent little story about two teenagers from different worlds taking different paths, but moving alongside each other.  Their meeting and friendship are unlikely, but this drives the story.  There is peril of the Romeo and Juliet kind as both pox their houses and fall into a love that ends in predictable disaster.  It's not a great or original story, but it was interesting enough to keep me reading.Sadly, the last third of the book begins with a terrorist attack that decimates much of the US and its dystopian aftermath.  This plot line doesn't have to be terrible, but it is in Mr. Percy's execution as he takes a story that is intimate within the whole of its world into one that is more like a disaster-thriller - all action, no characters.  I kept wanting Shelley Winters to appear to lighten the load as if America had become an overgrown Poseidon Adventure.Mr. Percy has written what is intended to be a serious book - rising above its genre to tell us an allegory about hate and the injustices that are done because of it - and that's the problem.  The seriousness of the literary attempt gets in the way of the story.  The author's choices are painfully obvious ones and even the naming of the werewolves as Lycans is unoriginal (see also the Underworld movies).

The author has the ability to incorporate current business issues and successes and make them relatable to Sun Tzu\\'s principles.In general, I have been a bit disappointed in literatures for managers, yet The Art of War for Managers brings me a new inspiration. The author is able to integrate great sayings that are very appropriate to the situation discussed. Sun Tzu provides us with wise advices such as \"Fight only battles you can win\". This book brings a new perspective of the strategic literature. Sun Tzu\\'s principles are timeless; they could be applied thousand years ago and have still application in today\\'s businesses. While at a first look to the book, one can expect to use literally military tactics to business; it is not exactly true. Sun Tzu actually gives us advice on how to organize our strategy so that we do not have to fight. I never realized how military tactics could be so much related to business strategies. The managers\\' examples placed at the end of the book are very interesting. It actually shows that applying Sun Tzu\\'s principles is working and that business managers using them are now successful companies and were pleased with the guidance of the fifty strategic rules for managers.The Art of war for managers would be tremendously beneficial for recently graduated students as it will help them see the big picture and associate known principles to real world settings. I am really impressed the immense level of wisdom of Sun Tzu. Michaelson\\'s writing style makes the book very easy to read. I enjoy the structure of the book; each chapter consist of a passage of Tzu\\'s The Art of War, a translation done by several translators and a manager\\'s commentary in which the author match Tzu\\'s principles to successful firms that are using these concepts. Although several of these rules are common knowledge, many times managers are overlooking these rules and make highly costly mistakes for their businesses.One negative that I regret about The Art of War for Managers is the redundancy of certain elements of strategic rules. The subject of leadership is viewed and reviewed throughout the book. By the end, it makes this subject a bit monotonous. Another drawback for me is that I feel that Michaelson sometimes is drawing parallels very easily and I am not sure that some of Tzu\\'s principles can be applied to business settings so simply. Also using deception as a useful tactic in competition goes against my ethical values. I do not think that encouraging employees to spy on the competition is morally right. I would recommend people to read the original The Art of War of Sun Tzu and then make their own application to their business issues and solutions. Overall even though I feel that there are some drawbacks, these powerful ten-minute lessons will help anyone looking for personal enrichment as well as business success.', 'summary': 'The Art of War for Managers: Great!

Youngblood is a Vietnam veteran who is struggling to realize the \"American dream,\" hoping to buy a house for the mother of his child.  Becker, the owner of the jitney station is facing its closure by the city and the recent release of his son, Booster, from prison.  Booster is starting his life anew after serving 20 years for murder.As these characters tease and verbally spar with each other, Wilson shows a variety of perspectives on the African-American experience in the late 20th century.  As Youngblood put it, \"If you can\\'t change the way you look at me ... then I might as well surrender now.  I can\\'t beat your memory of who I was if you can\\'t see I\\'ve changed. ... no matter what I do, I can\\'t never do it right, \\'cause all you see is the way I used to be. ... You don\\'t see I\\'ve changed.\"  This is echoed by Booster, who later in the play says, \"... I decided right then that dreams didn\\'t mean anything in this world.  You could be the president or a bishop or something like that.  You can dream you got more money than Rockerfeller.  See what happens when you wake up.\"  In spite of these broken dreams and the sense of inevitable failure, Wilson continues to offer hope to his characters, much as America continues to offer hope to its downtrodden.The barbershop banter and lack of action makes for a pensive piece, much more so than many of Wilson\\'s other plays.  It is a powerful play nonetheless.', 'summary': '\"You want to make something of your life, then the opportunity is there.\"'} \n",

From my vantage point as a research scientist, Merchants of Doubt solves a mystery that has deeply troubled me for many decades, and in that sense I rank it among the most important contributions to public discourse of the past several decades.The authors lay out in vivid detail the story behind the &#34;merchants of doubt&#34; -- a small cabal of ideologues with excellent scientific credentials whose purpose is not to refute the science behind such global issues as the dangers of cigarette smoke and climate change but to weave doubt about the science into the public debate around these topics.  In concert with their corporate sponsors and with the unwitting (some would say witless) help of a &#34;fair and balanced&#34; media they succeeded in muddying the waters of many an issue in which the science was indisputable.  What I hadn't realized before reading this book is that the scientists who lend their names and expertise to this process of obfuscation are doing so not for money, but for ideological reasons that have to do largely with a lingering anti-communism and an almost religious faith in &#34;the magic of the free market&#34;.  As a scientist myself, I have often wondered why men (and they are invariably men) with good scientific training would engage in the smarmy business of trying to undermine rock-solid scientific evidence.  This book shows that my early suspicion that they were simply paid off by corporate interests is wrong.  It appears, in fact, that the motivations are related primarily to a profound fear and disdain for government regulation of any kind.  What we have here are the machinations of free market ideologues using their scientific credentials to stymie government action of any kind in dealing with large-scale public health and safety issues.Merchants of Doubt, meticulously researched and elegantly written, should be required reading in every science class in this nation from high school through college.  Who could have known that the climate change deniers of today include many of the very same merchants of doubt that go all the way back to denying the dangers of smoking (and of second hand smoke, and of acid rain, and of ozone depletion, etc. etc.) and that the methods used to muddy the waters of public debate are precisely the same?

In the best tradition of John Dewey\\'s vision of education as a journey that makes for a more fully formed, flourishing human beings as well as a more informed citizenry, Maxine McClintock has constructed an intricate and compelling account not just of the fictional student Emilia\\'s winding \"senior year odyssey\" toward college (and beyond) but also of the mentor-mentee educative process by which both share insights, learn, and develop through intellectual exchanges. The erudition here is striking and subtle. William James, Randolph Bourne, Dewey, Thomas Jefferson, and scores of other major thinkers appear and serve to propel the narrative as well as the analysis, provoking much bigger questions and concerns than simply: where should Emilia go to school? This is a book that interrogates the proper and best role of intellectuals and educators in society. It ponders the city \"as educator.\" It critiques and embraces the drawbacks as well as the opportunities provided by Emilia\\'s elite private school. It investigates the history of ideas and the \"purposes of a liberal arts education\" in a democracy. And it challenges readers to consider how self-awareness is and might be enabled via education as the book probes how and why this is not happening more in the U.S. At the core of this book, then, lies the so-called \"education crisis\" and the \"crisis of the humanities\" as integral to the \"dysfunctional meritocracy\" endemic to the contemporary educational landscape.Blending radical and conservative solutions, the book takes the form of a dialogue of sorts (akin in form to a more accessible Dialogues of Plato perhaps?) to focus on the individual person as the primary \"ends\" of education. Thus, Letters of Recommendation concludes the Emilia-Doc exchange by calling out poignantly \"to recover our original intent of equal educational excellence for all.\" There is much more to this rich extended essay than a brief review can detail, so do read it. The best audiences for this book are teachers, professors, parents of students navigating college selection/admission, and especially high school and college age students, but it is also a work that could and should be widely read by citizens far beyond this important audience.', 'summary': 'Rewarding Account of Contemporary Education Through the Eyes of a Student, a Teacher, and a College Choice'} \n",

      "1380000 th row:  {'reviewText': 'This marvellous compilation, published in 1996 by Emi \"References\", is a welcome reminder not only of how talented young Yehudi Menuhin was in those early years, with unblemished purity of tone (later on, perhaps through some weakening of the bowing arm, his tonal production acquired an uningratiating wiriness), but also of his unflinching involvement with the music of his time. He was closely related to another composer not featured here, Ernest Bloch (who wrote his Abodah for the 12-year-old Menuhin, as well as the late Solo Violin Suites), and to Enescu, whom he studied with. Later of course he became a champion of Bartok.Featured on this disc is the first recording ever of Enescu\\'s magnificent 3rd Sonata \"Dans le caract&egrave;re populaire roumain\" (In the Rumania Folk Character) from 1926. According to the notes, Menuhin and his sister Hepzibah had secretly learnt the piece and played it as a gift to the composer. Enescu, who besides being a composer was one of the greatest violinist of his time, later twice recorded the Sonata, once in 1943 with Dinu Lipatti (briefly available on a 2 CD-set from the Philips Legendary Classics series) and again with C&eacute;liny Chailley-Richez. The Menuhins also re-recorded the Sonata, 30 years after their first essay, as a complement to Menuhin\\'s collaboration with Ravi Shankar (West Meets East: The Historic Shankar/Menuhin Sessions).With the \"Impressions d\\'Enfance\" (1940), also for Violin and Piano, the Sonata is possibly the composer\\'s towering masterpiece, equal to anything that was written for these two instruments in the first half of the 20th Century. There, the composer invented a uniquely personal sound-world, inspired by Rumanian Gipsy music, rhapsodic and whimsical, and displaying a wide array technical effects used for their unique coloring and expressive possibilities: trills, mordents, acciaccaturas (also in the piano writing, lending it a unique, \"aquatic\" quality), upward portamentos, quarter tones, harmonics, non vibrato playing, sul ponticello (on the bridge), striking with the tip of the bow. Not surprisingly, the Menuhins turn out a reading that is stylistically very close to the composer\\'s own with Lipatti, though more spacious in the brooding passages, but as playful as him in the more animated ones. In the second movement, Menuhin is more spacious than in his 1966 remake and, above all, infinitely superior to his future self in the beauty of his tone production. The two partners hurl enthusiastically into the finale, with a tempo that is faster than the composer\\'s own, losing along the way some of the music\\'s rustic flavor. Only in the final page does Menuhin sacrifice some beauty of tone for the sake of raw expressivity. This is of course no hi-fi sound, though everything comes out very clearly, and it remains an invaluable historical document.I bought this disc for the Enescu and to me all the rest is bonus. It is great to have Menuhin playing (with Marcelle Gazelle in 1935) some Szymanowski (the only that he recorded), although the \"Nocturne and Tarantella\" op. 29 isn\\'t as mesmerizing and original as the Composer\\'s \"Mythes\" op. 30. Menuhin, quoted in the liner notes, recounts that he received a copy from Prokofiev\\'s Sonata from the hands of David Oistrakh when it was barely finished. It had been premiered in Moscou by Oistrakh and Oborin, and in the US by Joseph Szigeti, but apparently this version by Menuhin and Marcelle Gazelle was the first to be committed to disc. It is Menuhin\\'s only recording of it, and of any Prokofiev.The same holds true with the 1932 recording of Ravel\\'s Tzigane with Artur Balsam - Menuhin\\'s only recording of that piece and yet another link to Enescu, as Menuhin learnt the piece with the Rumanian composer and, quoted again in the notes, claims that \"he played it like no-one else, but this is almost the way he played it\". It is again a stupendous reminder of Menuhin\\'s technical proficiency in those years, and a lesson in giving Gipsy life and swagger while still precisely observing Ravel\\'s rhythms and technical effects. Menuhin practices three cuts however, two of them in some transitional passages for piano alone but one excising 10 measures with violin, at 7:07.Nonetheless this is an invaluable historical document, and an indispensable one for any admirer of Menuhin.', 'summary': 'An invaluable historical document, and an indispensable one for any admirer of Menuhin'} \n",

Chin wrote, \"We make our lives complicated in hopes that we can concoct contentment within ourselves and in our lives. Then we become dependent on the technology we created and wonder why we feel tired/stressed/rushed all the time. \\'Shower\\' is a movie that made me wonder if seduction works in reverse - if the modern man can be seduced by a \\'kinder, more simple\\' lifestyle.\"The reason I reference \"Shower\" is because \"The Girl from Paris\" seduces you in much the same way.  Sandrine is a young Parisienne making a pretty good living working in the computer field.  Despite having, as her mother points out, a good job, a nice apartment, and a man, Sandrine feels stifled and unfulfilled with her job and her life.  She decides to give up her technology job and signs up for a 2 year agricultural course.  As part of the course, she lives and works on a farm.  Little House on the Prairie it\\'s not.  One of her first tasks is to help drain the blood from a cow\\'s head after it\\'s been shot.  She keeps going nonetheless and after the 2 years, she decides to buy a farm of her own.Adrien is an old widower who lives alone on his isolated family farm.  His only friend and visitor is his old friend Jean. Adrien decides to sell his farm to Sandrine so that he can go live with his nephew in another town, but he wants to stay on the farm for another year before he leaves his lifelong home forever.If this were a cop show, Adrien would be the archetypal experienced, world-weary partner - as played to perfection by the likes of Dennis Franz and Jerry Orbach - to Sandrine\\'s naive, wide-eyed rookie.  (Jean is the comic relief.)  In many ways, the relationship between Adrien and Sandrine follows that stereotypical mentor-rookie relationship, but as played by Michel Serrault and Mathilde Seigner it\\'s more familiar and universal than prosaic and stale.  Those words only have a subtle difference, and same goes with the movie.  \"The Girl from Paris\" is about the subtleties of life - waking up to fresh air and open space, taking care of living goats instead of machines, and passing on these diminishing but important values to the next generation.As much as you want to embrace the simpler life, it\\'s not always a simple choice.  Even earnest Sandrine begins to doubt her choices during the long, cold, lonely winter on the isolated hilltop.  Whether she chooses to stay is for you to discover.This is not a difficult movie to watch; in fact, it\\'s quite beautiful.  The farm they filmed on was perfect, set atop a magisterial hill with breathtaking views of the Rhone Valley.  It really is Sandrine\\'s \"balcony of the sky.\"  Any Francophile would love this movie, but it has a bucolic charm that appeals to the overworked, overstressed person in all of us, from college students to CEO\\'s.  Have a glass of wine and pop in this movie.  It\\'s utterly charming and calming.  Let yourself be seduced by the French countryside and its offerings.  The character of Jean will positively steal your heart and so will this movie.', 'summary': 'The real \"Simple Life\" and a charming one it is'} \n",

It serves as my primary backup drive to mirror my MBP\\'s internal drive in case of failure. I also use it to store DV files for editing and other media files.Data transfer speeds are fast over Firewire 800 as expected.  Average transfer speed at 50% capacity is 27-70MB/sec.  Although a 16MB cache would\\'ve been nicer for a drive of this capacity, 8MB seems perfectly fine for most needs.  Firewire 400 speeds average 20-33MB/sec.  USB 2.0 is the slowest averaging 13-18 MB/sec.  Keep in mind that these are rough estimates and that read/write speed will vary depending on file size, the part of the disk it\\'s writing to, the level of file fragmentation, and your computer\\'s specs.  But generally Firewire 800 will be fastest and USB 2.0 will be slowest.Although this drive unit has no internal fan, the Seagate ST3320820A 7200rpm HDD is not silent.  Next to my MacBook Pro, the whirring of the spinning HDD is clearly audible.  When it\\'s reading or writing, the clicking of the drive head is also noticeable. Every HDD makes noise to a certain degree, with some quieter than others.  I\\'ve found Western Digital HDD\\'s to be among the quieter ones, Hitachi\\'s being fairly noisy and Seagate\\'s somewhere in between.  I keep the LaCie under my desk and don\\'t notice the whirring sound, but can still hear it click occasionally.  I don\\'t mind the clicks since that helps me know when it\\'s busy.  But the constant whirring sound on your desk may drive you batty especially if you work in a quiet environment.  So my recommendation is to put the drive someplace where you can\\'t see it.One feature of this drive is that it will spindown if you disconnect it from your Mac.  Some external HDDs continue spinning unless powered down.  The LaCie also obeys your Mac\\'s Energy Saver hard disk sleep settings.  The default spindown time I believe is 10 minutes.  There are various third-party tools that allow you to modify the spindown time.  I just use Terminal and the \"pmset\" command to modify this.  For example, to change the spindown time to 45 minutes when my MBP is connected to a charger, I enter this in Terminal:sudo pmset -c spindown 45One caveat about modifying the spindown time - this setting affects all drives connected, including your internal drive.  So you will need to choose what spindown limit is reasonable for all drives.  (Personally, I\\'m ok with 45 minutes on mine.)One last thing... if you plan to use this drive as a bootable backup drive with your Intel Mac, be sure to first re-partition the drive using the GUID partitioning scheme.  This will be one of your options in Disk Utility.  You\\'ll then be able to backup your internal drive or install OS X onto the LaCie and boot from it.  The default partition scheme out of the box is Apple Partiton Map, which is bootable for PowerPC Macs.  To boot with Windows you will need to repartition it as Master Boot Record.To sum up, I\\'ve had a good experience with this drive and would recommend it to those looking for an affordable, large capacity, Mac compatible, Firewire 800 drive.', 'summary': 'Reliable external Firewire 800 hard drive for Macs (or PC).'} \n",

Have been painting over previously painted wood, previously painted drywall, and recently puttied or spackled areas that needed repair --- and the end result has been excellently consistent.This shorter handled brush has become one of my favorites as it is very easy to manipulate in and around the tight confines of the many angles of a windowsill and door-frame with ease. I thought that my hand might tire quicker given the short handle, but that has not been the case at all. Not having the long handle actually makes it so much easier to hit that tough, recessed spot.Clean up has not been any more difficult for me than with other brushes. I use lukewarm water with liquid soap to give the brush a good cleaning, then do a final rinse with hot water and hang the brush to dry. Not only have I found that they clean fairly easily, but (unlike the other brushes) in the 40 to 50 hours of use so far I can not recollect even one bristle on any of the brushes coming out. These brushes really are well made.If you have a need similar to mine and are looking for a really good brush to lay down a nice coat of paint on your interior trim, I heartily recommend this brush and the line of other Zibra brushes. Surely made my job easier and my wife much happier.Go for it.', 'summary': 'Zibra Paint Brush - Oustanding brush for latex on interior windows, door frames and other trim'} \n",

But, unless you are very technical, you should limit yourself to the quick configuration level. Anything else is too complicated to set up. I had interacted with 4 tech supports. They don't let you wait and they are polite but they can not help you on advanced settings and they claim the product is End of Life. What you get is what will be like. So, I had to figure out most advance settings by myself.MAKE SURE you don't use USB interface as the quick start guide tells you. It is not necessary and most likely the usb software CD won't install any way.You just connect C-400 to your computer directly with Ethernet cable. After manually setting the IP address to 192.168.0.11, you can begin the setup. For simple user, the initial installation should only take 5 minutes.But, if you want to do more, it is an entirely different story.Important setting options:(1) Set it as a DSL modem only: Tech support did not know how. I found a review on [...].Under quick configuration:Encapsulation: 1483 Bridged IP LLCBridge: EnabledIGMP: EnabledUse DHCP: DisabledDefault Route: Disabled(2) Use it as a router but want to set parental control:You need to enable bridge filter under service. (3 tech supports don't know this). You only can set it when the PC to be control in on line because you need to use Mac to block the internet access. C-400 allows you to set as many rules as possible while other routers mostly let you set only one.(3) Use it as a router but want to set SNTP to get the time from internet:Under Service, click SNTP and enter the domain name: [...]. You need to enable it (which the tech support did not instruct me so). After this, under Home, with modify: you need to select time zone (which Tech support said no).Without STNP, every time the modem loses power, the time will not be accurate.-----------I teamed up C-400 with a gigabit switch and a gigabit Ethernet wireless-n AP. The combined 3-piece solution outperformed Netgear DGND 3300 (3-in-1 solution). This issue of Netgear DGND3300 is that, although wireless-n connection claims 270mbps, the transfer between LAN and WAN is limited to 16 mbps. If you have a networked hard drive, it is better not to use this integrated solution because one bottleneck will defeat the purpose of having wireless-n. Initially, I would team up C-400 (as a dsl modem) with Neargear WNDR3700 (a 2-iece solution). But, the tech supports did not know how to set it up as a passthru modem. So, I purchased gigabit switch instead.I upgraded my ATT DSL to 6 mbps and C-400 operates at full link speed. Now, I can stream HD movie from netflix with excellent video quality.I recommend this product only if you just want a simple DSL modem router with no advance settings.\", 'summary': 'Product End of Life, Easy installation, advanced setup very difficult'} \n",

He ends up at Landers Air Force Base in Mississippi.  There are so few Jews at the base that he has difficulty assembling ten for a worship service.The portraits of David and his family, the Chaplain\\'s School, an air base in the still-segregated South, an air refueling wing flying the KC-97, the Strategic Air Command, and a deployment to Goose Bay, Labrador, are unforgettable.  The plot allows for some interesting discussion of command, marriage and unfaithfulness, Israel and the Holocaust, and interfaith relations.The author, Rabbi Herbert Tarr, had been an Air Force chaplain, so he wrote from first-hand knowledge.  He wrings a great deal of gentle humor from David\\'s inexperience, his attempts to apply rabbinic knowledge in unexpected situations, the ordinary human frailties and foibles he encounters, and the dilemmas faced by aircrew and young airmen.  A twenty-first century reader will enjoy deciding what has changed, and what is enduring, about the Air Force since the novel was published.  I served in the Air Force in the 1970s, and as I read the novel I said to myself, \"yes, he\\'s been there.\"This lighthearted treatment then gives way to Labrador and its stresses, and then to the ghastly collision of a B-47 and a fully-loaded tanker over Landers AFB.  Chaplain Cohen must console, heal, and make sense of all the tragedy.In the end, Chaplain Cohen\\'s \"conversion\" is to a deeper sense of humanity, a deeper feeling for the mission of the Air Force and the nation, and a stronger conviction that faith gives meaning to a person\\'s -- and a nation\\'s -- life.During the Air Force\\'s 25th anniversary in 1972, an Air Force Academy Department of English study judged The Coversion of Chaplain Cohen one of the three best novels of the Air Force.  Many Air Force novels have been published since then, but this novel would surely remain high on any new list.-30-', 'summary': 'A moving novel of faith, understanding, and commitment, told by a Jewish chaplain in the Air Force'} \n",

They were written by the young Bach before the cantata sausage-machine, the incessant shagging and the resultant mouths to feed drained him of youth. Somewhat hesitantly, one could acclaim them to be Bach's Sturm und Drang. Yes, the dance element is every present but two thirds of them are in a minor key and declamatorily at that. The expansive fugue that opens the Fifth Suite is surely one of Bach's greatest creations: even at its close, one senses the composer could have spent eternity chasing down its last elaboration.The English Suites have been well served by discography. Wherein lies safe anchorage?They say that Glenn Gould was so taken by the playing of the young Andras Schiff in his favourite composer that he invited the young pianist up to his infamous apartment - the Werewolf's Lair - to discuss all things Bach. Sadly, the young Hungarian emerged unscathed - perhaps a lupine bite-mark or scratch might have infected him with a demonry that has been manifestly lacking over the course of his career.These are cultivated, thoughtful and animated performances. No overt romanticism intrudes on proceedings and the part-writing is sprucely articulated. Rhythmically it cannot be gainsaid. All in all, Schiff is more vital than a dry-as-dust survey of these works by a Moses lookalike whose beard covers the keyboard of a clattery 1218 Ruckers harpsichord. But sadly, a certain primness carries the day.The bass-line in Bach is the voice of God - and sometimes his infernal counterpart intrudes on proceedings. However ephemerally, a pianist such as Richter (Authorized Recordings: Bach) is able to conjure Real Presence with his left hand - I cannot hear it hear here: Schiff it either too timorous or lacks the wizardry to evoke this dimension in the lower stave. Consider the opening movement of the Sixth Suite in D Minor: Richter unleashes a conflagration whose fire-front rapidly consumes the listener; Schiff is listenable enough but not engulfing. The Russian pianist also has the wider tone.The great pity here is that Richter only recorded 3, 4 & 6 on this particular set.

It is the gaming keyboard for Sith lords!The number pad is detachable and the magnet that holds the two parts together is pretty strong so you will not detach it by accident. This is my favorite design and the main reason why I chose this keyboard over all other gaming keyboards.The keyboard has a flat laptop like design which may or may not be what you want.There is a dial / wheel for the back light and also for the volume! I highly prefer a dial / wheel design over buttons.The back light has a true red color while the back light for macro keys are amber.Has a few media keys and also has a calculator key (on the detachable number pad).Has cruise control, mode switching, macro keys, etc for gamers who may chose to utilize those.3 year warranty!(Logitech G15 - 1 YR | Razer keyboards - 1 YR | OCZ keyboards - 1YR | Saitek - Hard to find..., but either 1 or 2 YRs)Negatives:The keyboard has a flat laptop like design with less gaps between keys, than standard keyboards. This makes me look down to see where I am going to type much more often compared to normal keyboards.Perhaps with more time I will get used to the X6, but I prefer typing on the G15 compared to the X6.The esc key is not above the ~ key whereas the esc key is above the ~ key on probably all other keyboards. This is one of the more annoying aspects of this keyboard. The reason is Microsoft decided to make the F keys longer than normal...Would be nice to have switchable colors so it can match certain desktop setups, such as a blue back light. I would prefer green since it is the color of good ol\\' paper back money. :)Yes, I would also very much like a dark green lightsabre instead of a red/blue.Might accidentally snap the connections between the keyboard and number pad (be careful).There is no keyboard feet/legs/stands on the top back side so you cannot adjust the height. It may take some getting used to for some users.I\\'m not sure on the exact number of keys that can be hit simultaneously, but so far I have had absolutely no problems in any game.Edit: Just found out it does indeed have a moderate sized flaw in that the user cannot reload while crouching and moving at the same time...Notes/other thoughts:I went from using a Logitech G15 (blue) to this. The G15 was a great keyboard, but it was quite long and I never used the LCD. I loved the volume dial / wheel on the G15 so getting another keyboard with the dial / wheel was a must.The X6 keyboard is isopropyl alcohol (rubbing alcohol) friendly unlike the G15. I ruined the pain job on two G15 keyboards since just a bit of isopropyl alcohol can make the paint smear.Since the X6 does not have a LCD screen I would love to one day try out the dishwasher method to clean the keyboard. This cleaning method worked well with other standard keyboards, including a Saitek Eclipse, but I was too afraid to try it with the G15 (LCD).I would imagine pairing the X6 with the Microsoft sidewinder mices would give a better gaming setup in terms of having a uniform look.I have not tried and do not intend to try out the macro keys so I am unfamiliar with how well it functions and if the software is user friendly. If needed to be the number pad can also function as macro keys.It would be awesome if the detachable number pad was wireless so I would not have to reattach it to use it.Conclusion.The Microsoft sidewinder X6 is an excellent gaming keyboard geared towards users who want a keyboard that has a cool stealth fighter or Star Wars dark side look, and also is bundled with a lot of gaming and practical designs. The most distinguishable feature compared to other gaming keyboards is the detachable number pad, for the user that needs a little extra space.There are a few downfalls (i.e. laptop/notebook flatness w/ lack of adequate space between keys) or conflicts with user preferences (i.e. back light color), but overall I would give this keyboard an 8.5/10.*The biggest downfall is the lack of feel while typing which makes me have to look down in order to find the correct keys. A huge negative for gamers who need to react quickly in a competitive setting.*Edit: Listed in the negative section, but... \"Just found out it does indeed have a moderate sized flaw in that the user cannot reload while crouching and moving at the same time...\" I would take another star off of my review for this reason, but unfortunately I cannot edit the number of stars.', 'summary': 'Excellent Gaming Keyboard w/ a Hint of the Dark Side.'} \n",

Unfortunately, this latest model is far too buggy to use day in and day out.  I have used the device on an iPhone 3G and iPhone 4 for approximately eight months.Connectivity:One of the most annoying problems I have encountered involves the device dropping its connection to the paired phone.  During a conversation the headset will simply stop working entirely.  Only turning the device off then back on will reestablish the connection to the phone.  This occurs even when the phone and the headset are within feet of one another.  I have received complaints from my callers that I sound muffled on occasion.  This will come and go with no particular frequency.  Finally, the microphone will cut out at random.  I will still be able to hear my caller, but they will not be able to hear me.  All of these issues occur at various intervals.  Given enough time on the device you will encounter them.  I don't understand how something using a standard like Bluetooth can encounter so many issues with its connectivity.Ergonomics:The Voyager Pro's buttons require a significant amount of force to activate.  It's enough force that, when coupled with their location, the headset will shift off your ear when using them with one finger.  Effective use of the volume controls require that you hold the bottom of the headset (near the mini-USB port) with your thumb while pressing them down (they are located on the top of the unit).  If you fail to do this the headset with crush down on your ear.  The call button, which is located on the boom microphone arm, forces you to hold the microphone arm while activating it.  Again, unless this is done you will shove the earpiece uncomfortably into your ear.Beware of using this headset with facial hair.  The foil screen on the microphone will snag facial hair and do its best to yank it right out.  Even running your finger over the inside microphone foil screen will demonstrate its crude rough finish.  Personally, I find the headset uncomfortable to use with glasses.  It is very bulky in the rear and is perhaps even larger in this aspect than the old Voyager 510.  All of that mass will interfere with the ear hooks on glasses.  This particular complaint will obviously vary based on the shape of one's own ear.Noise canceling:The effectiveness of the noise canceling is best described when compared to comparable models on the market.  From my own testing, the Voyager Pro cancels noise far less effectively than a Jawbone II, which is another headset I have used for an extended period of time.  It's only mediocre when compared to other modern headsets.  You'll still need to closely watch the noise of your environment when using the Voyager Pro.\", 'summary': 'Drops the connection to the phone, voice muffled to your caller, mic will cut out randomly'} \n",

So that was a good surprise.  I am not actually going to order two more of these.I know that one of the pics show someone putting 4 rifles in the case.

A psychological portrait of loss and alienation form the crux of this film which presents the more negative aspects of a unique artist.  Charting a timeframe from 1964 to 1971, we see Lennon reconnect with an estranged father, become entangled with Yoko Ono, dismantle his marriage, disband The Beatles, take up political activism, and eventually leave Britain altogether.  As with most bio-pics, there is plenty of fact and plenty of invention.  I do think \"Lennon Naked\" portrays an interesting side to Lennon, but any historical background or context is rather rushed.  It probably helps to come into \"Lennon Naked\" with pre-existing knowledge of the events in questions.For me, the primary reason for watching \"Lennon Naked\" is Christopher Eccleston\\'s uncompromising performance (even if he\\'s a bit old at the outset).  Never does the screenplay try to endear us to Lennon or soften his edges.  I found that to be the most refreshing aspect of the picture.  Eccleston has literally and figuratively stripped down Lennon and presents us with a man very difficult to like, and in doing so has created something that feels very real.  Ultimately, though, your appreciation with \"Lennon Naked\" will be determined by your expectations.  There is surprisingly little actual biography--just snippets of a life lived.  This is a character piece in which Lennon systematically pushes everyone away from him with a standoffishness that is surprisingly candid.  It is the self-indulgent artist versus the world, at least until Yoko shows up.  The film eventually tries to explain some of Lennon\\'s emotional disconnect, which results in arguably the finest dramatic scene, but can be summed up rather tritely as \"daddy issues.\"In truth, I didn\\'t love \"Lennon Naked,\" but I did admire it.  There is no doubt that Lennon was a visionary and a genius, but this film barely hints at the talent that made him unique.  Without any real glimpse of the artistic Lennon, the unpleasantness of a man who continually alienates the most important people in his life can seem a bit one-note.  At 90 minutes, there\\'s only so much this BBC production could cover--but it\\'s so unrepentantly bleak.  I wanted more time to see a fully rounded Lennon.  As a psychological portrait, which is the primary goal of \"Lennon Naked,\" I ultimately wanted something more in-depth.  The emotional payoff didn\\'t offer enough dividends for me and I ended up slightly disconnected from the film.

It pulled up so much dust you would have thought I'd vacuumed the entire house!  I was astonished.  Then I tried the attachments to pick up needles on the Christmas Tree skirt.  It worked like a charm.  I vacuumed a little more of the rug and the amount of dust and dirt it pulled out of the rug was unbelievable.  This is after religiously using a bissell vacuum that recently broke.  Needless to say, I'm keeping the vacuum.I agree with many reviewers that say the power cord should be longer.  25 ft is not very long at all.  And the hose should be longer as well.  And a quick contract button for the cord is something I would expect to see rather than having to wrap the cord around and around and around.I'm not sure how well the lift away works yet but am a little suspicious given that there were separate assembly instructions for the upright vs the lift away.  I will update my review once I try lifting it away.Pros:- Works amazingly well and pulls out WAY more dirt than my bissell ever did- Very light- Easy to assemble once you find the instructions- Attachments are ok.- Easy to maneuver- Did I mention how well it works???!!!Cons:- Cord does not auto retract- Cord should be longer.- It is tall which is great for tall people.

I bought the Touch to compare the two and am very impressed with it.  Which is better is 100% a matter of personal preference between physical page turn buttons and being able to touch select things rather than arrow key to them.  The only thing that is hands down better on the Touch (and the new Kindle) is the metal body and compact size.  I love that much more than the cheap plastic on the Kindle Keyboard.The trade-offs you have to make is between touch access to things on the screen and the physical page turn buttons on both sides.  I personally like the physical buttons on the Kindle Keyboard (and new Kindle) better for turning pages and the touch screen on the Kindle Touch better for selecting things on the page, such as getting a definition or an \"X-Ray\" of a word or phrase.  X-Ray, which only exists on the new Kindles and not Keyboard is a nice feature, but not a deal breaker.For me, I am going to stick to my Kindle Keyboard because being able to use the hard buttons for page turns is a big deal for me.  My daughter also uses both a lot, and she opted for the Touch because she frequently has to look definitions up and that is much faster on the Touch than on the Keyboard.  She agrees with me that one handed page turns are better on the Kindle Keyboard, but feels that she can get used to doing page turns on the Touch.A comment on \"Special Offers\" (AKA Ad supported):  This is our first Kindle that we\\'ve opted for the Ad supported, $40 cheaper version.

He\\'s also known as a man who gives people chances to shine in his film, not just as acting talent but also as part of the crew.For the 2012 film \"The Lockout\", Besson produced co-wrote the screenplay for the film with co-directors/co-writers James Mather and Stephen St. Leger (the film would be the duo\\'s directorial debut).The film would star Guy Pearce (\"Memento\", \"L.A. Confidential\", \"The Hurt Locker\"), Maggie Grace (\"Lost\", \"Taken\", \"Knight and Day\") and Vincent Regan (\"300&#8243;, \"Troy\", \"Unleashed\").VIDEO:\"Lockout: Unrated Edition\" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1 aspect ratio).  The film looks absolutely fantastic on Blu-ray!  From the opening scene of seeing the stubble on Guy Pearce\\'s chin to the closeup of Maggie Grace\\'s eye.  And the fact that a lot of the film\\'s settings are CG, there resolution is high and detail is fantastic.  It\\'s important to note that the film is more on the cool side, as the film is shot in a metallic structure of blues and grays.  But overall, \"Lockout: Unrated Edition\" looks impressive!AUDIO & SUBTITLES:\"Lockout: Unrated Edition\" is presented in English, Italian, Portugues 5.1 DTS-HD MA and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital.  And as one can expect from a Besson-related film, that is plenty of action.  There are explosions galore, gunshots galore, metal breaking apart, people being slammed, a chase scene... the lossless soundtrack for \"Lockout\" is immersive, chaotic and for audiophiles, they will love the immersiveness of this film.  Dialogue is crystal clear, music and special effects are crystal clear, great use of surround channels and LFE.  Impressive!Subtitles are in English, English SDH, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES:\"Lockout\" comes with the following special features:Breaking Into Lockout - Making Of - (11:07) Featuring the directors and cast talking about their characters and working on the film.A Vision of the Future - Production Design & Special Effects - (10:13) Interview with Frank Walsh (Supervising Art Director), Oliver Hooge (Art Director) and richard Bain (Visual Effects Supervisor) talking about the visual effects of the film and the use of green screen.EXTRAS:\"Lockout: Unrated Edition\" comes with a slipcase plus an UltraViolet code for instantly stream or download to PC or Mac.JUDGMENT CALL:Guy Pearce has been given new life as the action hero Snow in the film \"Lockout\".  While directed by James Mather and Stephen St. Leger, \"Lockout\" has the look and feel of a frenetic Besson popcorn action film!\"Lockout\" takes the banal concept of things go wrong in prison and it\\'s up to one man to save the day.  Seems very Jack Bauer (for those familiar with \"24&#8243;) but the prison is set in space and instead of grungy concrete walls, you get metallic, danky prison settings, we are given a green screen CGI futuristic prison setting which actually looks very cool!In fact, the sci-fi futuristic visuals are well-done.  The visual effects crew were very good in focusing on creating a sci-fi look and feel of the film.  But working entirely in green screen also presents a major problem with the fact that many actors have problems in acting when no one is there and reacting when nothing is around you but green. They have to trust the director and crew and it\\'s not the easiest thing to do for an actor.And so, this presents the problem of \"Lockout\", the acting.  While I thought the wisecracking, stoic Snow worked well for Guy Pearce, anyone wanting more depth with his character will be sadly disappointed.  If there was anything that really didn\\'t make sense or work is the one man having to infiltrate the prison to save the President\\'s daughter.  One man?  President\\'s daughter?  Farfetched isn\\'t it? For some people, it was.But audiences should know by now, Luc Besson films are popcorn action films that are not meant to be taken to seriously.From \"La Femme Nikita\", \"Leon: The Professional\" and even the \"Taxi\" films, these films revolved around a single person getting involved in some trouble but yet managing to save the day despite the odds or how crazy things may seem.It\\'s like watching a Roland Emmerich film, you know there will be tons of action and a lot of destruction in the world.  No way should one expect anything deep or romantic, you just sit back and enjoy the ride.I am in awe to read some people who felt disappointed that \"Lockout\" was not mentally challenging or there was not enough bloody violence.  And once again, I bring up the fact that this is a Luc Besson film.  This is not a David Fincher film, nor is it a banal horror film.  The film is about one man trying to save the President\\'s daughter and get the hell out of the prison.The antagonists are angry prison inmates and the callousness of some of these inmates are shown effectively (many innocent people randomly) and yes, even the president\\'s daughter, Emilie, played by Maggie Grace, the scared and fearful hostage (although, we have seen this before for Maggie Grace in Besson\\'s other film \"Taken\" and wouldn\\'t be surprised if we see the same type of emotions coming from the character in the upcoming \"Taken 2&#8243;).But the fact is that these films are never meant to be serious, they are popcorn action films, nothing more and nothing less.As for the Blu-ray release, I\\'m not entirely sure what scenes are unrated as the original runtime is 95 minutes and the unrated version is 95 minutes.  But I can say the film looks absolutely fantastic in HD courtesy of its CG environment.  Closeups are full of detail, such as one scene where you can see the stubble of Pearce so clearly, or even the detailed cuts of a character.  The film looks excellent on Blu-ray and it has a lossless soundtrack that is also quite immersive, considering the many action scenes.  The disappointment was mainly of its two only special features.  An audio commentary or more special features other than two, would have been nice to have on this Blu-ray release.Overall, \"Lockout\" was a film that I enjoyed.  And for those who enjoy popcorn action films, especially films in futuristic settings will definitely enjoy \"Lockout: Unrated Edition\".', 'summary': '(3.5 stars) An average sci-fi action film but an immersive Blu-ray release!'} \n",

When it broke, and I went to buy another one, I noticed that in many many shark reviews, users mentioned that it tended to live only about a year, which was my own experience. Considering that they aren't cheap, I started reading reviews for a comparable or better steam mop that would live for a longer time. Over the course of a week, I browsed reviews on every single steam mop available for sale on Amazon among other sites- the Monster seemed to do very well across the board. I have owned it now about 6 months and I am NOT happy. First let me preface this by saying that I am a single female, living in NYC- My apartment is not large, and I do not have heavy foot/animal traffic in my home. My shark replaced my traditional mop,floor cleaner fluid and bucket ENTIRELY. I am a very clean person who is rather meticulous about my home, and when there are large spills, I use a sponge/paper towels, floor cleaner,elbow grease, etc- i.e I use my steam mop for traditional linoleum/wood upkeep and general dirt removal NOT for large accidents or spills. I am also an aerialist weighing about 135 lbs and I haul my body weight around by my arms and legs while suspended in the air- i.e- I am much, much stronger than your average female. I mention this specifically because in my ll by 7 foot kitchen, the drag on this thing is RIDICULOUS- I am literally dragging it back and forth, putting in a ton of effort to move it along the floor to the point where I break a sweat, my arm gets tired and my back starts to ache; in a TINY kitchen! I'd put up with the effort, no problem, if the thing cleaned well, but it DOES NOT! 1 person's foot traffic should be no trouble to remove from floors, but after several passes in one area, the dirt does not come up much. So I end up getting out my sponge and cleaner and going down on my hands and knees to spot clean the areas that the monster simply could not combat. I NEVER had this issue with the shark. Also- as mentioned previously, my apartment is a TINY NYC apartment- with the shark, one tank cleaned the kitchen, hallway, living room and bedroom, often with water to spare- NOT the monster.I'm lucky if the kitchen is semi done in one tank. Perhaps, since I have to make 10 passes to achieve half the result of 2 with the shark, I am using a lot more water- granted, that must be true- but considering the monster only takes 2.5 of the given water filler cup that comes with the unit ( which equals to one standard size coffee mug and a half of water), I have to let the unit cool down entirely before filling up again to do the rest of the apartment. What used to take me 15 minutes to do with the Shark, now takes me an hour with poor results to boot. Lastly, besides poor cleaning ability and heaviness, this thing, as pictured, is structured like a dome- and it's lip only juts out about a half inch in front of the dome- so along the cabinets and sideboards, this thing does not even touch the perimeter at all since it's reach is obstructed by the large dome on top. Basically, I am throwing it out after giving it a very long trial period, and resigning myself to spending about 100 dollars a year on Sharks.\", 'summary': 'READ THIS- I did a lot of research when my last steam mop died'} \n",

It\\'s acceptable, even fun, providing you can get past the atrocious, juvenile errors/lack of editing. Don\\'t get me wrong--I can definitely suspend my disbelief.

I\\'m sure the author worked hard on these books, and I respect that effort so I generally find it hard to write bad reviews.That being said, at least once a chapter I had to put down the kindle, unroll my eyes, and question whether I REALLY wanted to spend minutes of my life with these books whether or not they were already paid for. I actually didn\\'t finish all the books in the set, but I did come close. The writing really IS quite juvenile. At first I thought the author was trying to channel juvenile, uneducated characters.

There is still some violin and soft acoustic guitars, but not as much as in their previous albums.The Heidevolk style of songwriting is still clearly present, but there are a few changes.  First off, I don\\'t know if Joost has always been able to drum like that, or if he\\'s just been practicing for 10 hours a day, but whatever the case is his double bass drumming is spectacular! His black metal roots really come off much more in this album than in the others.  It reminds me of Hellhammer\\'s drumming on In Sorte Diaboli by Dimmu Borgir more than Joost\\'s own drumming 2 years ago in Uit Olde Grond.  Just 1 second into Wapenbroeders, and you\\'ll hear exactly what it is that I\\'m talking about.Wapenbroeders is my favorite track on this album, not only because of the double bass work in the drums, but also because of the vocals.  While Joris and Mark have always sung unisons and octaves very well, they sing quite a bit of a section harmonizing in thirds.On, the subject of voices, there are a bit more choral \"ahs\" and \"ohs\", but they almost always feature some nice vocal harmonies in the lines and not all just solo or unisons.The only slight complaint that I had was that they had a misprint in the album booklet.

This only heightened my own appreciation of the author\\'s, Dr. Roger N. Buckley\\'s, profound knowledge of complex world histories and political movements. The hero/anti-hero and one of the unifying \"threads\" is Professor Relph Coggins, whose self-serving materialism thrusts him into the race to locate the cloned Gandhi. Another compelling thread for me as a reader is the gradual development of the cloned Gandhi\\'s character as the \"object\" of everyone\\'s search and how this character engages \"nature versus nurture\" debates.  As details of the cloned Gandhi are pieced together, his character evolves from being an ephemeral, almost-unbelievable figment of everyone\\'s imagination or nightmare - depending on the politically perceived interpretation of his existence - to a young Gandhi whose sheltered existence and vulnerability only complicate and challenge views of his being an \"it\", a scientifically engineered pawn, versus a living, breathing human being.

Let\\'s face it, the walking dead are everywhere! I\\'m certainly not complaining, but it\\'s becoming increasingly difficult to find entertainment that still feels fresh and vital.  With a cover blurb that references HBO\\'s stellar \"Band of Brothers,\" \"War of the Dead\" seemed like an interesting new addition to the zombie lexicon.  The film does not go for the cheesiness or camp factor that you might anticipate when dealing with the assault of WWII monsters.  It\\'s a refreshing choice, to be sure, to play things somewhat realistically.  Ultimately, though, the movie crosses two genres (war and horror) without really making a strong mark in either.  As a B-movie, \"War of the Dead\" is perfectly serviceable entertainment.  I\\'m pleased enough to have watched it, it just isn\\'t incredibly remarkable or memorable enough to make it a must-own proposition.The movie starts out on a high note with a chilling teaser scene that hints at the horrors yet to unfold.  After this promising introduction, the story settles into its primary groove.  An American squad is advancing upon an underground bunker with the intention of destroying it.  After dispatching a group of enemy soldiers, it appears that the foes simply won\\'t die.  They meet a Russian soldier along the way who may know more than he\\'s telling.  Can the living band against the dead?  And what atrocities await the survivors once they reach their final destination?  Most of the battle scenes are handled capably, there are plenty of armed confrontations.  Things are lively throughout, and I found the experience entertaining enough.  I just never felt much excitement over the journey.\"War of the Dead,\" in the end, may not completely satisfy either war movie buffs or horror enthusiasts.  It\\'s a good idea, the execution just feels completely routine.  The battle sequences are fine, but they are akin to many other low budget endeavors that you can catch on late night TV for free.  The zombies, though, are fairly unremarkable and present nothing new to the party.  If you are looking for extreme scares or plentiful gore, this film didn\\'t fit that bill for me.  I go back to the standard of expectation.  Had I watched this for free on cable, I\\'d have been happy (although I don\\'t think I\\'ll remember much about the movie in a few months).  However, to purchase the Blu-ray is a harder recommendation.  \"War of the Dead\" passed the time once, but I don\\'t really see myself sitting down to repeat viewings.

The aim of this book is to advance your understanding of anatomy so that your overall quality will improve in both the short and long term.'He divides his book into chapters that slowly advance the reader form the materials to the completed drawing. In the opening chapter he thoroughly discusses materials, listing all the items necessary from pencil and ink and paper and including digital mediums to draw with, mixed media - very complete and accompanied with photographs of each of the tools needed just to make it simple. Next he advances to Basic Shapes (forms from one to 3 dimensional), then Perspective. His major chapter is on basic anatomy and he offers ample illustrations in drawings, muscle diagrams, and skeletons including how to create poses. This is followed by a brief but very clear explanation of the Golden Rule - an here he discusses the Fibonacci Spiral or the Golden Spiral is achieve the beautiful line. In chapter six (`In Detail') he teaches in extreme how to draw the head, eye, nose, mouth, ears, neck, torso and hips, the back, arms, hand, fist, legs, feet with drawings of models that show how to build from blocks to human form.Then comes the magic - `Putting it all together' - and this chapter is so fine it could be hung on gallery walls. He takes multiple figures and starts form the initial line drawing, goes through all the steps in the preceding chapters and comes up with many characters that are very impressive.

I'm a mystery/thriller buff but when I start looking for books in this genre, generally I find a vast array of the same old, tired themes that don't jump out and grab me. &#34;Lorna Doone (yes that's her real name because her father was a crazy bastard who just loved those cookies and slapped her with the silly handle at birth) is a recovering alcoholic private investigator who needs a bump in her career after she made a serious mistake and lives were lost in Philly, her home town. She moves to Podunk, Utah where, to her surprise, there's a string of cruel murders she must solve, only to find they're being perpetrated by the most badass serial killer to ever walk the planet. Johnny, the erstwhile deputy sheriff who has never seen such action winds up helping her in unusual (and romance-building) ways.&#34; You get my drift. Yuck: why must we be subjected to the same old rehash of this theme?This book is COMPLETELY different: fresh, new, exciting, exhilarating. The setting is raw and unusual. I immediately care a lot about the characters and especially the tertiary premise (troubled teens go to a last-chance rescue camp taught by an expert survivalist). The antagonists are super-creepy and Koryta has introduced some new ways of thinking about creepiness that I have not seen used before. Love, love, love the firefighting angle. Koryta gets into the action right away and stays there. There are unexpected tangential aspects you had not considered.What's clear with this book is that Koryta took his time to hone the thing down to the crispest, meatiest possible reading. For example, even if you don't care about topo maps (or don't know what thy are), Koryta makes you care. The fire description scenes are horrifying. I actually Googled the firefighter boots to see if they exist (they do and he's right, they're dreadfully expensive). My idea of camping is going to a Motel 8, showering and snuggling up in a warm bed with a good Kindle book. But now I want to go backpacking in the Montana wilderness. That's the power of this writer's expertise. You're drawn in: you're right there backpacking with these kids.When the book's description says that there's some underlying horror elements, it's not talking about paranormal stuff: it's talking about people who've gone so far off the reservation that you wonder how they got where they are today. You find yourself wanting more backstory on these creepy dudes. Their mom and dad had to have been prize-winning parents.And Koryta has the cojones to actually say that all super-elitist survivalist training, regardless of whether they're Army Rangers, Navy SEALS, whatever - come from the Air Force! Wow, I like that take-off because the Air Force never gets any strokes. Not sure I believe it just because he says it, but the premise works in the book. You have no doubt this protagonist can pull it off. Or not. You are actually taught survivalist techniques and you're like &#34;Cool! Good to know!&#34;Truly you will find yourself mad that you dropped $13 for a book you'll knock out in 1.5 hours. It's that good. I will DEFINITELY buy more Koryta books.

I ordered 4 of these bulbs, and all of them work on arrival.  I chose to spend a dollar more and get the 6.5 watt dimmable Lighting EVER LED bulb instead of the 5 watt bulb of the same brand that didn't claim to be dimmable.  There is a reviewer that mentioned how the different light levels weren't functional on their range hood with the 5 watt.  I figured I would want a fully functional range hood with all levels of light.  This dimmable bulb, sort of, delivered.  I do have two levels of light.  However, there is a barely noticeable strobe on the lower level.  It is not horrible flickering, it is very minor, but I am sensitive to such things.  I like a good steady light with no strobe to it at all.  The higher level is a steady, warm, and very bright light.  I'm thinking I will only use it on the highest setting because of the strobe, so maybe I spent $4 extra.  It is an LED and should be energy saving and last nearly forever and I love that it isn't hot.  Since I am using it on a two level switch and not a dimmer, I don't know that it would be fair to lower the rating due to the strobe on the lower level, so I still feel comfortable giving 5 stars.

      "3950000 th row:  {'reviewText': 'Compact, great automatic features, access to manual controls and... takes great picturesBOTTOM LINE:With each generation, Samsung makes the \"WB\" series easier to use and still get great results.  Like its predecessors, this one fits into my front pants pocket (or the case I recommend toward the end of this review).  That point alone may make this the best camera you own; having a $5k DSLR doesn\\'t do you much good if you left it home because it wasn\\'t worth the effort to lug it along.However, unlike many other small cameras, Samsung had designed a camera that works with, rather than trying to compete with, your phone or tablet.  They do this without sacrificing either features or quality.  Even low-level manual control, things like setting shutter speed, lens aperture, ISO, are available *without* being buried deep inside menus.  However, it is done in a way that doesn\\'t get in my way when I don\\'t want to bother with it.  This camera is designed to leverage convenience and technology while still providing control when I want it.DETAILS:The camera body has a sleek appearance and a solid feel.  The pebbled finish that covers most of the camera looks like leather and, more importantly, aids in getting a secure grip.  And, if you don\\'t care about the \"mechanics\", it makes for a very nice looking camera.One issue with all small cameras is the built-in flash.  They are underpowered and create red eye.  Both problems are caused by the need to keep the camera small; the flash needs to be small and positioned close to the lens.  Samsung addresses in a number of ways.  Firstly, they include a powerful (for a compact camera) flash to pop up and out of the camera at the press of a button.  Secondly, the lens is designed to let in a lot of light so I don\\'t need as bright a flash in the first place,  Thirdly, the \"sensor\" is very accurately captures pictures even when there isn\\'t a lot of light available.  The result is an image that is remarkably sharp, even in low light.  In fact, I can take pictures in a well-lit room without having to use the flash at all.What sets this camera apart is how well it integrates with a phone or tablet.  In my case, these are iDevices and I haven\\'t tried it with any of the Android options available.  However, with iPhones/Pads, it is a matter of downloading a free multi-purpose app.  After that, transferring photos from my camera to my phone/tablet is as easy as pressing a button on the camera (it is a real, honest-to-goodness hardware button) and starting the app.  From there I can quickly send one or a bunch of pictures from my camera for editing, embellishment, and probably posting to Facebook.  There are a boatload of other wireless capabilities like using the camera as a baby monitor and using my phone as a remote viewfinder and camera control.  To me, though, the biggest and most heavily used feature is the ability to easily and quickly move pictures from the camera to a device that can \"send them off\" from anywhere in the world.Things of note:- This camera does not have a GPS.  Based on my experience with other compact cameras that do have that feature, they tend to shorten battery life dramatically and I don\\'t miss it.- This camera uses a mico-SD card.  That\\'s not a bad thing, you just need to know to have one on hand and now you do.  My recommendation is to get a relatively fast card with a large capacity.  I\\'m using theSanDisk Ultra 16GB MicroSDHCand it works just fine.  The time between shots is about halved when I use aSanDisk Extreme Plus 32GB MicroSDHCinstead.  For nature shots it\\'s not such a big deal.  However, if you are taking pictures of people, and especially kids, I would definitely recommend the faster card.Some other suggestions that apply:Normally at this point, I would put in some details about manually setting ISO or selecting a color space.  However, for most people buying this camera, it just isn\\'t relevant.  You are buying this camera because you want to take great pictures without having to worry about that stuff.  The good news is the Samsung WB350 has several \"automatic\" modes where it makes those decisions for you and does a great job at it.However, as I mentioned above, this camera stands out among others in its class in putting this level of control at your fingertips when you care to use it.  If you do want to \"take your photography to the next level then a great resource is theConfessions of a Compact Camera Shooter: Get Professional Quality Photos with Your Compact Camera.Finally, I\\'ve found theCase Logic TBC-312 Pocket Video Camcorder Caseis just the right size for this camera (and is surprisingly inexpensive It\\'s made even better by using one of these,Nite Ize SB1-2PK-01 Size-1 S-Biner, Black, 2-Pack, to secure it to a belt loop.', 'summary': 'Compact, great automatic features, access to manual controls and... takes great pictures'} \n",

He's never toured here before, so I was excited to see how his shows look live.Visual ( &#865; &#860;&#662; &#865;)&#65279;After seeing it now, look, i'm not trying to sound bitter or anything like that, but some parts of this things visual representation is over used and I was sick of seeing it by the end.I understand that Rob produced this himself.. and I can understand using either an effect to recreate, or perhaps even using an 8mm cmaera for that old grainy 60's/70's home video effect. But honestly, I think I wouldn't have minded had Rob just used it during one song, and not made it a continues theme throughout the whole concert. It became pretty annoying by the end when it goes from HD to that and back again constantly. I don't get what Rob's fascination with using those angles was for the duration of the whole concert? He didn't use the split screen effects in anything but one song, so why continually use that annoying one? Especially since for most of the time it's shooting into the audience and showing fights happening in the crowed by drunken idiots. Who the hell wants to see that?Also some of the footage seems to be out of place. I have a feeling the 8mm footage may not actually be from this show recorded in Texas. As when you look into the back of the stadium, there is no outside, but then it cuts to footage from a grassy outdoors area. Still, no biggie, who cares, right? Just an observation.Audio ( &#865; &#860;&#662; &#865;)&#65279;The sound is mostly perfect. There was a couple of times now and then I thought there was too much bass in the mixing, but the sound for the most part is fantastic... for what they recorded anyway. Sometimes Rob's voice sounds out of breath, but i've known that for years. I think what it comes down to is we mostly listen to the recorded versions and forget they had 100 goes to get a pitch right, or mixing and effects can really make certain things stand out. So I do admit, it was much more popular numbers like &#34;Living Dead Girl&#34; & &#34;Dragula&#34; is where I noticed it mostly. But I won't deduct stars away from the performance just because of that, it's just something singers do and are victim to, so I can except it as something out of their control... not to mention you probably grow tired of singing the songs night after night the same way, so you do change things up. So don't go into this thing expecting to hear word for word the way you hear it on albums. However Rob's energy through the show is much higher than I thought! You can tell he's drained by the end of the show, but he puts on a hell of a show!Cons ( &#865; &#860;&#662; &#865;)&#65279;- Only thing on this disc, DVD or Bluray, is the concert with 3 audio options... then there is a photo gallery. Come on Rob, you're a movie director, you should know by now fans love bonus footage. Why is nothing else included here? One idea would have been to have an option to watch the movie the way you cut it... then have another version fully in HD without those 8mm shots, and then one you can guarantee no one will watch from start to end with the all 8mm version. But then again, even if it had that, we would still complain we want more. Couldn't we have bonus performance footage, like when Rob joins Alice Cooper on stage, or vice verse? A few older live performance shots of songs not on this set list? Anything would have been nice. But no one considers trailers or photo galleries to be bonus features, so technically this release has zip bonus content.\", 'summary': \"Decent... but don't bother with BluRay.

      " review: There but for the grace of God . . . goes any sincere, hard working, well meaning, struggling middle class parent.  Shaw's phrase &quot;too true to be good&quot; comes to mind.  This is a harrowing story, full of those little details that make it so real and punctuate the enormity of the situation the author faces and describes.  It is every parent's nightmare come true, and only the hardest heart could fail to feel for the author, her daughter, and the rest of her family.Relieved of about 100 pages, this would be an excellent book.  As is, the book, like its author's anguish, just seems to go on and on and on, sinking at times to grim and somewhat fatiguing repetition.  I read this as a possible book to assign to my college class, and I had to conclude that many of my students would be reluctant to plow through all of it.My advice to would-be readers?  If you have had to deal with a very troubled teen, then run, don't walk, to obtain and read this book.  For the rest of us, if you are a fast reader and/or have plenty of time, give it a try, as it is a very good and worthwhile book.  If you are a slow reader, or if your reading time is limited, you might want to consider the &quot;opportunity cost&quot; of investing your time here.  I enjoyed it, but I might have spent the time better.One thing for all readers--and the author--to bear in mind (and I speak as a psychologist):  In all probability, nothing the author did, and nothing the author failed to do, was primarily responsible for her daughter's plight.  That may be the hardest thing to accept, and/or the greatest relief in a miserable situation; but it is definitely one of the most important lessons of the book.  My hat is off to the author for having the courage to write and share her story.  There but for the grace of God . . . . \n",

      " review: I nearly gave up on this book after about five pages.  I am SO glad that I kept on.  This writer seems to capture the time, characters and vernacular of the particular time period as well as crafting an intricate, perceptive mystery.  His turns of phrase and witty comments kept making me re-read passages, both to ensure my understanding as well as to enjoy the glittering prose.  I felt that I needed to read this in a quiet room without extraneous noise--I both wanted and had to pay close attention to what was flowing past my eyes.HIGHLY recommend.  I will read every one of these mysteries, then gladly do so again in a few years. \n",

      " review: SIX GOOD INNINGS tells the tale and pretty much carries the flavor of how a small town little league team begins to learn and appreciate their game. Nicely constructed prose from author Kreidler, himself an ESPN guy shows that he knows the feel of a good bat, belting one perfectly on that sweet spot and the resonating sound of getting it right.Toms River would produce a great group of kids who learn about winning and losing... and winning and losing all over again. The transition from youthful innocence to a wiser bunch of lads who learn how to keep going on is a compelling read, and so perfectly American that it deserves kudos and your time.The bottom line is I loved it and couldn't put it down for too long. Let it break your heart a little because it certainly will. This is little league with clarity and soul.Mark BraunExecutive DirectorOld Timers' Baseball Association of ChicagoSince 1919 \n",

      " review: This is the sequel toRed to Black: A Novel, which I had not read.  You don't need to have read the first book to understand this one, but reading Moscow Sting likely will spoil the events of Red to Black.  (For that matter, reading the plot summary of the second book probably spoils the first one.)Anna is a former KGB colonel who defected to marry the British spy she was assigned to monitor.  Her husband was killed by the KGB before the opening of the book and she is in hiding with her young son.  The British, Americans and Russians all want her because they believe she is the only one who knows the identity of \"Mikhail,\" who provided her late husband with Russian intelligence.  An American private intelligence company gets to her first and a significant portion of the book involves the process of working her to disclose his identity and contact him to make him an American intelligence asset.This book was OK for me but it didn't have the suspenseful tension that makes for a truly compelling espionage novel.  The author has filled it with a lot of information about the politics of the spy business -- the use of private intelligence companies, the KGB's control of Russian business enterprises, political \"horse trading\" between the countries.  But he tells it to the reader in a way that makes it just so many facts.  (I'm assuming he has done the research to make it accurate.)  Another thing that made the book less exciting is that it felt fairly believable.  The Americans holding Anna didn't torture or drug her to get the information -- they interviewed her.  Endlessly.  And, with one exception, there aren't gun battles or wild chase scenes.Believable action scenes that would be too tame for the typical blockbuster spy movie need something more to draw the reader in -- an emotional tie to the character.  This book has so many different characters and points of view that it is difficult to get emotionally involved with any of them.  Anna is the obvious center of the book but the author puts in too much extra stuff -- a subplot involving an assassin named Lars was an unnecessary distraction from the central story -- and the connection with Anna suffers.Finally, some of the details make little sense in the context of the story.  Anna's handler suggests she take a gun to a meeting where she will be otherwise unprotected.  Of all the handgun possibilities, she improbably requests a single shot pistol with a very long barrel to hide under her clothes.  And unless this is covered in the earlier book, Anna is much more familiar with New York City than she should be.Fans of the espionage genre who like a lot of information in the story and don't need page-turning action should enjoy this book.  For me, I wanted action or emotional connection to the characters and didn't feel either one. \n",

Don't get me wrong...I read the Sweep series, too.  It just isn't authentic.  People complain that this series is 'boring'.  I admit it is slow at times, but LIFE is slow at times.  This book is about personal empowerment in teen girls, about growing up, about taking responsibility for your own actions.  I think this series has excellent moral value.  Many of the other series have only entertainment value to speak of.  Not that THAT is all bad...Circle of Three just isn't that.Read this series if you want to learn about how faith can help you get through tough times and become a better person. \n",

      " review: For the price of the book, you would expect some great tutorials and explanations on 3D Studio Max.  However, it skims over many things and tells you to just type in some numbers and draw some lines without  explaining why you are doing certain important tasks.  It's supposed to be  an animation book primarily, but it does not contain that many chapters on  animation.  In addition, the chapters on modelling with the program are  weak in that they show you how to model things that have no use in the real  world.  Instead of this book, buy Inside 3D Studio Max.  It is a huge book  that explains a lot more about this complex program for about the same  price.  Some positives of this book are that shows you how to do some  special effects like explosions and rain quickly, and the steps were fairly  easy to follow.

The anticipation grew after the first few times reading it, and he would happily join in the conversation with the cat, the teddy, the wind-up hen, and the Old Uncle; until finally YES!  he found a Mommy.  How joyful!  Then he found a Daddy and his family was complete.  Now my three year old daughter joins in on the fun.  I've loved this book from the first read, and never tire of the little boy's sad story with a happy ending.  Janet and Allen Ahlberg are masterful, in their artistry and their storytelling.

      " review: Beth Revis' Across the Universe is the first book in an intriguing dystopian sci-fi trilogy.  After spending two hundred fifty years cryogenically frozen on a spaceship bound for an uncharted planet, Amy is shocked when she is awakened fifty years before her parents are scheduled to be unfrozen.  At first, the prospect of not seeing her parents until she is nearly seventy seems like the worst of her problems.  But in addition to the nightmare of being trapped on a claustrophobic ship and the horror of discovering that many of the ship's inhabitants behave more like drones than humans, she soon learns that a killer is targeting the cryogenically frozen people and her parents may be among the next victims.  From the largely homogeneous and eerily obedient crew members to the ship's dictatorial leader, Amy finds herself very short on allies.  Thankfully, the young man who is next in line to lead the ship is intrigued by Amy, and he may be exactly the ally she needs to keep her parents alive and to figure out how the ship's population has gone in such a disturbing direction in the two hundred fifty years since it left Earth.  But Elder grew up on the ship, and what seems horrifying to Amy has always been described as normal and necessary to him.  Together they must unravel the truth and stop the killing before it is too late.What I Liked:-  This book is set on isolated ship hundreds of years away from Earth and some of its inhabitants have made difficult (and troubling) decisions regarding resource management, diversity, and personal freedom.  I was impressed by how disturbing and claustrophobic the atmosphere on the ship feels.-  Half the chapters are from Amy's point of view and half are from Elder's point of view, which helped keep the tension high from start to finish.  This book is essentially a dystopian novel set aboard a spaceship, so being introduced to the world from two different perspectives, that of a character who is an outsider and that of a character who has only ever known life aboard the ship, really helps set the stage for the story.-  Elder's friend Harley, an artist who is considered an oddity because of his creativity, is one of the most compelling characters in the book.  Elements of his situation reminded me of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, and his outlook as the story progressed brought to mind some interesting questions about what life could have been like if things had progressed differently on Godspeed.-  My favorite sci-fi novels (as well as my favorite dystopian novels) tackle ethical and political issues that are relevant right here on present-day Earth.  If the setting is well conceived and the story is compelling, great sci-fi and dystopian novels can encourage us to examine hot-button issues like genetic engineering and reproductive rights a bit more thoroughly.  I liked that Across the Universe didn't shy away from pushing some of those concepts to disturbingly plausible extremes.-  There are some very unlikeable individuals on Godspeed, but some of their motivations held shades of gray, and I like villains who are painted in shades of gray.  They are much more frightening and believable.-  There is plenty left to be explored in the next two books and the story is wide open for a million different possibilities, but this first book is also surprisingly conclusive.  I look forward to seeing where the rest of the trilogy will go.What I Liked Less:-  One of the primary mysteries in this story, the identity of the person unplugging the cryogenically frozen individuals, is too easy to deduce.  Thankfully, that is not the only twist in the story, so there are other surprises and deceptions to keep readers on their toes.-  While I liked that Elder and Amy's story is not of the whirlwind-romance variety, I was hoping to feel more chemistry between them.  I respected and pitied them both, but I didn't really care whether their relationship ventured beyond friendship.  Perhaps the second book will change my mind about that.-  I found the plot and setting a bit more compelling than the protagonists.  Amy and Elder both have to deal with some sad and traumatizing situations in this book, but I was more wrapped up in the plot than the characters, so I never found myself in tears.I would recommend Across the Universe to fans of sci-fi and dystopian novels.  The story moves along at a fast clip, with short chapters and quite a bit of life-and-death drama, so it may also be a good pick for reluctant readers. I look forward to reading the second book, A Million Suns. \n",

After 5 years of training in psychiatry, and early into my clinical practice, I have yet to come across a better explanation of the very difficult clinical concepts in dynamic psychotherapy.  This book is a pleasure to read, and will help the new clinician or trainee to rest at ease with even the most challenging psychotherapeutic situations.  It is a clinically oriented, practical and actually helps the reader understand what to say and do in a therapy session - something that all the theory in the world can't help a clinician to do!

      " review: I ordered Word Hero with great expectations, being a writer myself. But I have to admit I was a little disappointed in this book. Don't get me wrong, Word Hero has some very interesting information in it, but you have to wade through a very long-winded prose to get to the good stuff. I like to have information presented in a more straightforward fashion. For a book which is supposed to be a guide to crafting short witty lines, the author seems to have a bit of a hard time getting his points across without a long-winded explanation. I would have enjoyed this book much more, and gotten much more out of it, if it would have been better organized and more to the point in each chapter.Word Hero does have some redeeming qualities though. It would be an excellent resource for writing teachers or language arts teachers. It has a wonderful appendix included, which I liked much better than the main body of the book. The appendix has an easy to use section that guides the reader concerning which \"tool\" to use for different purposes, a section that list technical writing terms, and a section that list and describes the \"tools.\" The appendix is very useful, especially for someone who is teaching any type of writing class.Overall, I thought Word Hero was okay, but it left me wishing that it was organized a bit differently and that the information was presented in more of some type of outline form, which would have been much easier to grasp and learn the different \"tools\" which Mr. Heinrichs presented in his book. I give it 3 Stars.Bohdi Sanders, author ofWisdom of the Elders \n",

      " review: First the analytical: Franzen has a terrific turn of phrase, marvelous vocabulary, but remains very readable.  He builds suspense in the smallest spaces of the human mind, and yet sees the importance of the big picture, and leaves gorgeous clues as to where his characters will find themselves, or where they see themselves.  Like Pynchon and Wallace, he treads the sometimes surreal area between the landscape and the land, and lets the reader often decide which, but he does not venture so far into his own mind that you forget which story he is telling.  His structure is brilliant, reminiscent of vintage Faulkner in his timeline, but honestly his ability to tie events together throughout his characters' histories, and present the results of past actions as beautiful surprises in the prose reminded me more of Thomas Hardy.  Readers unfamiliar with literature might need to keep a dictionary handy, but I always enjoy that aspect of prodigious novels.  However, Franzen is here to tell a well constructed story, not convince us that he's read the OED, which can't be said for some writers of equal stature.  Loving your family and friends despite their faults is what living life is all about, and someone able to attain that goal in a novel is a writer of literature, not storybooks or badly disguised scripts for Lifetime original movies.Those who stopped reading this book half way through completely missed its point.  Everyone has quirks and dysfunctions, and Franzen's laser beam eye for them does make the reader squirm, but squirm deliciously, at their own foibles and those of their own family members, and laugh at the same foibles. It's hard to find tragedy that's so damn funny.  But a dysfunctional family is simply the MacGuffin here.  This book is not about solving problems among family members (none of them get solved) but about the hope that lies beneath all hardship, the humanity behind the dysfunction.Readers who do not like these characters may be lying to themselves about their own idiosyncracies.  Although I identified a lot with Chip there is something in each of these characters that holds a mirror to the reader.  What Franzen possesses in great abundance is a love of people, a love of humanity that transcends the darker side of human behavior.  Without that love of humanity, there is no way he could have written this book.  When you reach the end, its ultimate message is hope, after all, true hope that it is never too late to be happy in life.  What better message can a book bring forth than that? \n",

      " review: I always hate reading and then reviewing a book that so many people love, especially when I can't understand why it gets the love it gets. I did enjoy the fact that it was a non-sci-fi story set against a sci-fi backdrop, and while I recognize that its themes of equality are universal and timeless, the themes were not my issue. My problems with the book:Pacing: It vacillates between long scenes between characters followed by long bouts of exposition. The exposition killed me. So much tell and not a lot of show. The bones of the revolution itself are glossed over in a recap chapter. For me, it came off as a fits and starts kinda thing.Character Development: This was a huge failure in my humble. I never sensed that Manny was a real person. He was very one-note and when the character was taken to levels, it just did not ring true. Wyoming was wasted. She comes on strong and then dissappears for the rest of the book- not literally, just as a functioning character of any value.Alright, so I had a problem with one aspect of the Themes: The Loonies are treated as if their outlook is the true way, truth and life. Manny describes them as almost utopian while in fact they are violent, rash and rather intolerant themselves. I get that this is his POV and that he is the narrator, but it feels as if this is the author's take as well. Though, to be fair, the point is probabbly not that the Loonies are right or wrong, it is that they are changed in the process of the revolution.Syntax: I know that the Loonie dialect is supposed to be different but it is very jarring to read.Mike: The development of the Mycroft character suffered from the same pacing issues. From his basic grasp of humanity to becoming the leader of a revolution, it just flowed strangley to me. While I was expecting a different end for Mike, I find that the end of the book is more satisfying the more I think about it.The book was a slogfest that, after Part I, I just wanted to be over. I recognize that the novel was very special and timely for the period in which it was written, but regardless, its pacing and character development left me wanting. Still, I am intrigued by some of Heinlein's concepts and will probably give him another shot at the title. \n",

Kiss Chase changed all that.I was hesitant to read this book at first because of the cheesy title and the adultery but I'm so glad I did. How could such imperfect characters be so perfect?Phoebe is the most fantastic heroine I've read about in a long time. Attractive in a quirky ways but has her good and bad days, never perfect. Not a genius or particularly successful but her love and loyalty, her humor and intelligence and her bravery all make success seem paltry in comparison. I was disappointed in how she let Staskia treat her though I think the author tried to delve into the mechanisms of bullying relationships tinged with rivalry and insecurity.As for Staskia, I hated her. I was not convinced by her redemption but the book was so fantastic that I just kind of ignored it. The things she did were just terrible.And last but not least, Felix. He is a real bad boy and not one of those beautiful, confident, successful jerks who immediately turn good after meeting the heroine. He was screwed up and it showed. His childhood and lack of real and meaningful relationships outside of one dorky friend crippled him emotionally. He does treat Phoebe badly at one point but she doesn't take his crap and I love that. I loved him despite or more likely because of all his faults and him and phoebe had off the charts chemistry (although I do wish there had been more detailed love scenes, *wink, wink*).Pheobe's adultery is off-putting though I think she really did love Dan before he hurt her and he did pursue her relentlessly. But I did love Phoebe and her character is so well written that she came across more as a good person in a bad situation than a homewrecker, scarlet woman etc. I wish Dan had gotten his comeuppance though.All in all, anyone interested in romance, fiction, complex characters and relationships should READ THIS BOOK.I'm sorry this review isn't very well structured or detailed but I'm in a rush and just needed to purge after that emotional roller coaster.Happy Reading!Recommendations: Beautiful Disaster_Jamie Mcguire, Rachel's Holiday_Marian Keyes, 50 Shades of Grey \n",

      " review: I must say I am surprised people have said Stover \"get's it.\" I don't think he does at all for several reasons. In a Star Wars book, there is little character development. Instead it's the talent of taking characters that already exist, and doing your best to replicate them perfectly. Stover however, did not. First, I had trouble imagining Luke, Leia and Han speaking in the dialect that they were in this book, in addition to other characters dropping the G in `ing' words. I'll give him some credit however, that he did a great job replicating Lando. Secondly, despite Han Solo being one who would do many things to make a buck, I do not think he would sell out Luke as a character in a \"HoloThriller,\" and much less have Leia support Solo's decision to sell Luke. Having said that, the idea of HoloThrillers just made me cringe. Yes, they may exist in the Star Wars universe. However, I don't think those in the Star Wars Universe would obsess over them. Overall, the idea of the 'HoloThrillers' just didn't do it for me at all.Additionally, Stover spent WAY too much time discussing the engineering specs of certain cruisers and devices in the book. Unless you are a professional engineer, those pages are a struggle to read. I found myself skimming through those pages, as the imagery just did not work. I'm not sure if others experienced the same, but I had a very difficult time creating an image during the battle scenes. The creative ship names were, well, creative, such as the \"Remember Alderaan\" and the \"Wait Minute.\" Those names weren't as distracting as where the many types of cruisers and ships that were difficult to follow.The book however has its moments. I liked the spiritual side of the force that is portrayed in this book. The concept of \"The Dark\" was interesting. Also, some of the hand-to-hand and ground battles were done well. I also found it interesting that he was able to write what is going in R2-D2's circuits.Overall, it was a poor book. It saved grace by getting a second star because I enjoyed a few things. However the characters obsession with 'HoloThrillers,' the inability to capture the main characters and the long-winded engineering explanations made this a struggle to read. \n",

      " review: Callum, Laird of the Clan, is a hard man, a strong and fair leader but he's never considered himself good. Never to be described as tenderhearted, these emotions were once foreign to him. But no more. Though he did not deserve such a rare flower as his \"pocket sized Venus\" the beautiful Lady Alys, the shy former handmaiden to his brother's wife had captured his heart from the moment his eyes settled upon her. And so began his campaign to capture her heart and win her for his own. Similarly besotted Lady Alys relented but with some restrictions; celibacy before they wed. Finally after a torturous self imposed seven month abstinence Alys was to become Callum's wife tomorrow, on Christmastide. And he planned on giving her the most wicked gift of all, twelve passion filled nights. If only................Hope Tarr returns to medieval Scotland with Twelve Nights, the sequel to her Harlequin BlazeBound to Please. Although not as scorching as the first book, this is by far the better written novel. A few clever twists make this historical stand out. Whats unusual is that Callum and Alys are in love in the beginning of the book and admit so freely. The purpose is to test their love by putting them into impossible situations. I won't spoil the plot but would say that its sort of a lovers-torn-apart theme.  This made the action quite exciting at times and kept me reading. Consequently, since they were apart, there wasn't as much loves scenes as one would expect in a Blaze and not nearly twelve nights as the title suggests. But those that were are definitely hot. So don't let that dissuade you from reading it.In all a really good Blaze that I recommend to those looking for a steamy-lite romance with some substance. \n",

      " review: Except for classical or historical novels, I admit that I am not much of a fiction reader. I picked this book up only because Norman Mailer wrote it and because he is understood to be one of America's foremost writer's of fiction. I had read a book by him about Lee Harvey Oswald and was so unimpressed that I have now forgotten its title. It was supposed to be non-fiction, but appeared to me to be anything but.Anyway, this book was my attempt to give Mailer another chance. It is of course about the brief period of freedom and then the ignominious death by firing squad of one, Gary Mark Gilmore. Charitably, Gilmore can at best be described as the \"scum of the earth,\" having spent most of his life in, rather than out of prison, from crimes as petty as liquor store heists, up to murder.Whatever literary value this book is supposed to have had, in my mind at least, was lost and over-shadowed by the wanton, random, and utter senselessness and brutality of the murders he committed before he was finally recaptured and executed.This, his last chance at freedom, was squandered like the rest of his life. Gilmore proved that he was not able to handle life on the outside because he had no idea how to go about it. Unlike his structured life inside, his life outside of prison had no rhyme or reason. What he knew how to do was to create chaos wherever he went.During his freedom, he was like the ball in a pinball machine, randomly bouncing along a downward obstacle course of life, where he hoped to be able to ring a few bells, hit a few bright lights and make a few noises before the lights were finally turned out on him for good. It seems that the script for the ending of his life had already been written: by him at birth. His life was an existential black hole, without hope.Somehow, Mailer tried to turn this foreordained tragedy into a love story between Gilmore and \"a trailer park loser\" named Nicole, but in my view it all was mostly a literary contrivance. This was not a story of hope: from the beginning, we knew there would be only a fiery ending to this saga. All that was left to do was to tie up the loose ends.The die sending Gilmore's life on its inexorable downward trajectory had already been cast. Instead of \"Mark,\" \"tragedy\" should have been Gilmore's middle name. Everything he touched turned to death and then to dust. He was, always the walking dead: A zombie brought back to life by Mailer's literary tricks.Even when he emerged from prison, all of his lifelines, as well as his nine lives, had been used up. He stood face-to-face with the existential precipice: It was \"over-the-cliff\" for him, and the sooner the better. Did anyone really think that Gary Mark Gilmore was going to live out the rest of his lost freedom and life as a gas station attendant? Better to go out in a blaze of ignominious glory. Which is what he did. Hell, even I could write that story?The only tension left for the artist to resolve was how many innocent souls would become the victim of this human wrecking ball. If it takes skill to resolve that dilemma, then leave me out. All I can see is the pain of those who died at his senseless hands. If there is art here I am glad I missed it.One star \n",

Neither one is directed against non-catholics, like an apologetics book.  Both are written mainly for average catholics like me.  However, I liked HAIL HOLY QUEEN more, mainly because of how it makes more of the old testament come alive.

      " review: Cult fave Irvine Welsh returns to his roots (so to speak) with this new novel featuring the characters from TRAINSPOTTING and his previous book GLUE. However, in PORNO the focus is on Simon \"Sick Boy\" Williamson, a decade on; failed in every career path he has trod- honest or dishonest. But Sick Boy comes across a new opportunity to establish himself in the world. By making a porn film.He enlists student Nikki Fuller-Smith to be his starlet and then sets out to rebuild bridges with his old pal Mark Renton- now clean and sober and \"Juice\" Terry Lawson.PORNO is an entertaining but deep read, by turns funny and disturbing with an interesting new array of characters and several narratives running through the book giving the characters unique point of view. Keep your fingers crossed for Danny Boyle and John Hodge to option this one. I suppose the filmed result could be a hybrid of TRAINSPOTTING meets IN THE REALM OF THE SENSES meets BEHIND THE GREEN DOOR. \n",

      " review: In this story, a grandmother and grandchild bear share an action-packed and fun-filled day before they cuddle up, settle down, and relax in the shade of a tree. The flow of this story makes it a great bedtime or `let's cuddle up, settle down, and relax' book. Some of the text might be over a young child's head. However, the soothing, rhythmic verse and illustrations make up for any complexity. The movement, body language, and detail in Satomi Ichikawa's illustrations enhance the lovely emotion behind the text. Ichikawa's colorful and tender illustrations convey Maryann Cusimano Love's message completely. The loving and fun connection between grandparent and grandchild shines through on every page.Many `read-together' books contain text that means more to the adult than to the child. These books often evoke the loving emotion that the adult feels for the child and enhances the sharing experience. The ones with top-notch illustrations and a soothing tone that grabs a child's attention make perfect read-together books. \"You Are My Wish\" is one of those books. Although, the book is worth purchasing for the illustrations alone, those illustrations would not exist without Maryann Cusimano Love's delightful message.Butterfly Kisses for Grandma and Grandpa \n",

The book is organized by rooms giving tips on how to save money on every room in your house.  The ladies even gave a neat tip on what to do if you didn't get enough sleep and feel tired the next morning which is to drink a glass of water with lemon in it.  I found the tips on washing and drying clothes at night because the electric company charges less money at night very interesting and something I didn't know.  I also loved the recipe on how to make your own laundry detergent interesting because I didn't know how to do that and have always wanted to learn how to do it.  This book is a great resource on how to make small changes in regards to what time you will purchase things for your home and beyond your home in order to save you money.  The authors even give you links to other websites that have more information.  I am single and don't have children so I skimmed over those parts  that talked about saving money on clothes and toys for kids but overall it is a well thought out concise book that will save you money.  I will definately recomend it to others so they can also save money. \n",

I&#8217;m not sure why I didn&#8217;t enjoy this part.  Maybe I would have liked more personality interaction instead of a series of bad things being thrown at them.THE BEGINNING AND END:I loved it.  I was laughing.  Here&#8217;s this little old lady walking into the CIA offices and saying &#8220;I want to be a spy.&#8221;  The guy is slack jawed and speechless.  And in the end, people saying &#8220;you did what?&#8221; amazed at what she did.  That was funny and good.  Also she changed the way she treated someone at the end, which was neat.This is book #1 in the series.I BOUGHT THIS BECAUSE OF THE AUDIOBOOK NARRATOR:I wanted to buy more books narrated by Barbara Rosenblat, and this was on her list.  She was very good, but I have two complaints.  This was recorded in 1989.  The recording equipment picks up her breaths and some swallowing which was distracting.  Second:  I did not like her fragile little old lady voice for Mrs. Pollifax.  She made her sound like she was in her 90s.  Most women in their 60s don&#8217;t sound like that.DATA:Narrative mode: 3rd person.  Unabridged audiobook length: 8 hrs and 16 mins.  Swearing language: mild, but rarely used.  Sexual content: none.  Setting: around 1965 U.S., Mexico, Albania.  Book copyright: 1966.  Genre: spy suspense. \n",

      " review: Don't feel like spending a lot of time writing a long review so I'll say what I liked and then didn't like.  Liked the fact, that I'm still sappy enough to get the teary eyes when Beth & Wrath had their human wedding ceremony and then again (but more of the stuffy nose as well) when little Wrath was born.I agree with many many many other reviewers who thought Ward had wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy too many storylines going on at the same time.  She gets this feedback from readers constantly, yet does absolutely nothing about it.  One must wonder why an author doesn't listen to the readers...Ya know, the ones who spend $12 damn bucks for a book?  WE PAY YOUR SALARY.Anyways, the story of Sola and Assail was left open and was entertaining but I wanted this to be in a different book; not this book.Also, knew the story of Xcor and Layla would continue and while it was decent enough to include them in this particular book because Layla was staying in the main mansion, the section about her and Xcor probably should have been placed in a book all on their own.  Their fate was pretty much sealed with their deal but so much more could have been done with them.All the mess with I'am and his brother Trez was yet another story line crammed into this one book and things were bubbling up to the surface and spilling over.  Much too much going on.  Ward, listen to your readers.  Stop stuffing the books spine gills with stories of 50,000 people at once.  Divide it up.  As the reader, you realize when you're reading about a large handful of couples and people that once you end a chapter or section about them, you know it will be some time before their part of the story continues because you've got to read about everyone else for a while.Also, once you got to the last couple of chapters, I started to feel really rushed; like things were quickly coming to an end.  Is this the last book in the series or are there one or two more?You really could end things here and not continue.  There really isn't any way for things to get better between Layla and Xcor and she deserves better.The Sola and Assail story could continue, but do readers care enough?Again, like many others, I wish the rest of the brothers had been in this more.  I miss them.  My favorite books in the series were wayyyyyyyyyyyyyy back around 5 & 6.  Loved the story of Viscous and Jane.  Might even be my favorite.Said I wasn't gonna write along review.

      " review: Simply put, this book talks about how to continuously (and systematically) keep investing money to reach your end goal. After reading this book I've become a huge fan of value averaging over DCA, primarily because of the following deficiencies with DCA:1) DCA never tells you went to sell (aka: rebalance your portfolio). For that you need to make a market timing decision or pick a random date to do it (suboptimal). If there was a mechanical way of saying, its time to sell, which was optimal, that would be good.2) If you invest $100/month in asset A; the $100 you invest in (month 1, year 1) != the $100 you invest in (month 12, year 10), because of inflation and the fact that over the long run the asset A has a non-zero expected return (which is the reason you are investing in it in the first place!)3) During severe market corrections. Think 1987 -23% style corrections, DCA will let you buy more shares for the fixed amount but makes no mechanical suggestion to actually buy a lot more sharesIn sum, VA is the following: It is a formula based investing strategy like DCA but it tells you when to sell (Think rebalancing). Here you make the value of the fund that you own go up every month and not the actual market price. Lets take a simplistic form of VA: Say you contribute $100 (=contribution amount C) every month to fund X. In month 1 the NAV was $1 and you bought 100 shares. In month 2 you want the value of your fund to go to $200, but it turns out the market price of what you own is now $127, then you contribute only $73 in month 2. In month 3 the fund tanks and value has gone to $150, then you need to put in $150 to keep your value in line to $300. If in month 4 the fund goes crazy and becomes $700 and your target was to get it to $400 you sell $300. No other mechanical strategy tells you when to sell.I strongly recommend fellow DCA-ers to pick up this book! \n",

      " review: There have been many writers who have written these Lomgarm novels under the name of Tabor Evans.They are very different in their writing styles and the author of this particular episode is very different from any of the others I have read.This writer's style hit me immediately with his excessive use of descriptive adjectives. This was particularly the case at the beginning.Here's a little example from page 13;\"Longarm's head snapped away from the conversation.He looked like a man who'd just been slapped with an open palm made of red-hot flesh-forged iron.A wave of pent-up,bitter-tasting bile,anger,and disgust swept through his entire being.His weathered neck reddened,and he jerked his tightly buttoned collar open for relief from the sudden upsurge of heat flowing toward his ears.All of a sudden he felt a discomfort from the soles of his feet to the roots of his hair.A murderous fury,generated from the intensity of long-suppressed feelings,swept through blood that bubbled,then instantaneously went to a lethal,skin-singeing,man-killing boil.\"At this point,I'd almost had all I could stand of this kind of writing; but I hung in and once the author got into the story ,he cut back on this endless descriptive writing and got to some great action,excellent story development and created some real engaging characters.However; whenever the storyline changed direction or whatever,the author would revert to the descriptive style.;until he once again got back to the story.I was left with the thought that this is a real talanted ,but maybe a somewhat frustrated writer who would prefer to be writing poetry or some other gendre;but to hold body and soul together ,writes other things just to survive.So,despite what I have said,I still found it a great read.Once again,I am obligated to make some comments on the cover's artwork. There were three exceptionally imaginative characters in the story.Kate Thorne,\"Spook\" Lomax,and Orpheus Nightshade,any one of which should have graced the cover and would have been excellent. Then,maybe a s scene from the Four Deuces Saloon rather than a church with grave markers alongside,which was not even mentioned in the story.Likewise there is no relationship to the photo on the cover of the fellow in shirt,tie and jacket.A much better effort from the \"Art Department\" would be a great improvement.Once again,this is a writer with a very different style,who developed real unique characters and built them into a fast-action sroryline and one I hope writes more in the series.How can one not like ;\"Longarm shook his friend's hand.A faint smile spread over his face as he said,'Trust me,Billy. From the moment you told me he was a hauntin' the area again,I never entertained the slightest intention of bringing him back alive. He's already dead--he just don't know it yet'\" \n",

She was able to read a few sentences here and there, but she really related to the protagonist Anna over their common reluctance to attend Chinese school on Saturdays. There are aspects about Anna that are very positive for a girl, such as not getting involved in catty behavior and comparisons/competitive nature of girls at that age. Anna presents herself as a girl who chooses to rise above peers reproach and finds ways to entertain herself. She is a productive girl who does crafts such as sewing, paper airplane folding, and reading, ie not frivolous activities. My only criticism is the lack of fact checking. Towards the end of the book, it is written that 1998 was the Year of the Dog. That is wrong. It was the Year of the Tiger. My daughter who was actually born in the Year of the Dog, was astonished that a book was published with such a blatant mistake in it. For that I give 3 stars. \n",

      " review: I enjoyed reading Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson's revisit to the universe of Dune but was dissapointed at the lack of depth and complexity of the book.  Characters were too black and white (the Baron was about as evil as you could possibly get, just in case you don't get the point he routinely tortures someone or thinks about tormenting someone in just about every scene he's in, and Leto is unsufferably noble and honorable throughout).  The characters were not as interesting as they were in the original Dune series, they lack the same depth and intriguing personalities.  The book overall is just too simplistic and not as intelligent as its predecessors, (Fenring and Shaddam just happen to come up with the brilliant idea to synthesize spice?  With such a demand for the rare drug why hadn't anyone else come up with the idea, for example the Bene Tleilxu themselves?).  Some more problems I had with the book, the class issue was delve into only very shallowly during the takeover of Ix and the revolt of the \"suboids\".  In the end the reader is left with the feeling that the ruling nobility was unjustly thrown from their seats of power and that the suboids were well taken care of (food, housing, and work all provided; why ask for anything more?) and had no right to complain; they were blindly led to their own downfall like sheep to the slaughter and they brought it upon themselves.  Somehow the whole \"ignorant masses\" thing doesn't work for me.  Also the portrayal of the Bene Tleilxu was way too much for me, all they seemed to say about them was that the Bene Tleilxu = evil, corrupt, and ugly.  Where are the shades of grey?  Where are the complex characters with complex motives?  Where is the intrigue, the mystery, the complicated plot?  All the brilliant revelations in this novel seem sub par and mediocre.  The book was so terribly predictable.  I also felt that Leto's miraculous victory in the trial wasn't so spectacular, and though he got a lot of acclaim and respect from it, he never actually did anything that led to his success.  He was the one that had to be saved.Now, this does not mean the novel wasn't enjoyable.  I definitely enjoyed going back to the roots of the characters and seeing where they came from.  Some of the ideas were interesting as well (though the details could have been worked out a little better).  If you are a fan of the Dune series I recommend the book as a chance to revisit characters and learn a bit more but don't expect anything on the same level as the orginal series. \n",

      " review: Diana, Princess of Wales, met a tragic end in the early morning hours of August 31, 1997, in what appeared to be an unfortunate traffic accident. Supposedly speeding through a Paris tunnel, driven by an intoxicated chauffeur, her boyfriend by her side, the car wrecked as it was chased by a horde of paparazzi.At least that's what you're supposed to believe.Authors Richard Belzer and David Wayne know the truth: Princess Diana was not only assassinated, she knew she would be murdered. She even knew how it would happen, it was simply a matter of when. Belzer and Wayne present the facts to prove what is easily one of the most shocking, deliberate acts of murder of all time. Even more chilling, when you realize those who carried out this heinous scheme got away with it&#8230;scot free.Two young boys lost their mother because their grandparents, especially their grandfather, Prince Philip, felt nothing but antipathy toward the beloved woman who was truly &#8220;The People&#8217;s Princess.&#8221; You, too, will feel the bile rise in the back of your throat as you discover the ways in which Princess Diana was used and abused by the Royals and those closest to the Mountbatten-Windsors.All too many of the terrible things you&#8217;ve heard about her, Dodi Fayed, Henri Paul, and others sadly involved in the tragedy simply are not true. Belzer and Wayne have impeccably researched this e-book, as they have their other collaborations, &#8220;Dead Wrong&#8221; and &#8220;Hit List.&#8221; The facts written here (and most carefully footnoted) are irrefutable &#8211; and terrifying. Thanks to Richard Belzer&#8217;s engaging writing style, his voice comes through as if he was sitting with you, relating the story personally.Princess Diana was only five minutes from a hospital, suffering internal injuries that she would have survived. A complex, covert plan was underway to ensure she didn&#8217;t live to see another day. That plan also included killing Henri Paul (her sober driver that night) and Dodi Fayed, her boyfriend whom by all accounts she planned to wed. In the process, bodyguard Trevor Rees-Jones was so badly injured his face needed extensive reconstructive surgery and he has limited memory of the events of that fateful moment. Ironically, he was taken to the very hospital where Princess Diana&#8217;s life would have been saved.&#34;Dead Wrong 2&#34; lays it all out there in extensively researched truth, so intensely compelling once you begin reading this e-book you won't be able to stop until you've finished. What you thought you knew has nothing whatsoever in common with what actually happened. This book sets the record straight, once and for all. \n",

      " review: I strongly caution against using this book if you are habitually tense, a slow learner, or if you need help adjusting your hand placement.My main gripe with this book is that it presents only a very small sliver of what is actually possible for a beginning-level piano student. The huge majority of melody-accompany pieces in this book use root-position C and G chords in the left hand, in the exact same voicing. For those of you who don't know what this means: the book reduces most left-hand accompaniments to the same two simple chords. These are just two chords, out of thousands (millions?) of possible chords. What will you do when you have to learn a different chord? Weep, I guess.Notice I only talked about chordal accompaniments... Yup, this book only goes over chordal accompaniments (and accompaniments that are based on chords... broken chords, bass-dyad, etc.). If I trained a beginner with this book and then gave him or her a very simple Bach minuet, the beginner would have no idea what to do.I urge potential buyers to look at beginner books that are marketed as &#34;contemporary adult&#34; method books. This &#34;Basic&#34; book does not have what you need. \n",

      " review: Brad Thor's latest action novel follows the mold of his previous works: a sinister plot to harm the United States that only one man, Scot Harvath, has the skills to stop. This time, the War on Terror becomes the backdrop of the book, as a deadly terrorist act causes death and havoc in New York City that is used as a red herring to launch a rescue mission to find one of America's latest terrorist mastermind prisoner. What follows is vintage Thor: shootouts followed by more shootouts and with Harvath having the time to take a serious interest in another female ally. Whatever Thor lacks in character development he makes up for in suspense. Recommended for the beach or a cross-country flight. \n",

      " review: I absolutely could not put this book down once I started reading it!  I read the entire book in 3 days!  And even after finishing the book I would go back and look over certain parts again.  I thought just reading articles about this book gave me enough information but that is not true.  The book is filled with so many details and important statements that make a person really think and reflect.  So many times I wished that I could have protected and cared for Kim Noble the body so she and her alters would not have had to go through so much pain and confusion and heartache.  I liked how most of the chapters had thoughts from the other alters (besides Patrica the dominant) so that the reader could learn more about them and their background.  Before reading this book I truly thought it would be best if Kim's body could be intergrated into one.  But I do understand more about DID after reading this book and how each personality has its own life essentially.  I certainly would not want Patricia to ever dissappear!  I can relate in that when something tragic happens to a person your mind can't bear it so it sort of hides it so you don't feel the pain as much.  However; it is amazing that these different personalities can develop and each not even know about the other and have special talents such as speaking different languages.  When Patricia realizes that she is an alter and that shares a body with all these different people and she wants to just scrub her body and put sand paper on her tongue was such a real, heart wrenching statement that I think anyone would think.  I kept trying to put myself in her shoes and think how I would feel or how I would react.  She is such a strong person!  I got the feeling that we have barely touched the skim of what really happened to Kim to cause her to split into all this alters.  But I completely understand that this is a healing process and a learning process and the body wants to protect Patricia and all the alters.  I have my own opinions about who I think may have hurt Kim when she was a baby but I think what happened may be worse than any of us could have guessed.  I hope that Patricia continues to write more books as her life progresses. I would also enjoy hearing the other alters' stories too.  I really like Patricia and hope that she continues to be the main alter.  That is how personal this book becomes as you read it.  And I truly think that having Aimee was the saving grace for the body.  They had someone special to love, take care of, and make sure that they took good care of themself for her.  A very endearing story that is a true story. Now I want to hear more!  I highly recommend this book to everyone!  Excellent story.  I would go on and on as I have so many questions and comments to make about what happened but I don't want to give too much away to future readers :) \n",

Why, it's the CARS!  Finally, a book has been put out on the cars of Fast & Furious. I love these movies.  If you want plain old good guys v bad guys entertainment without a heavy message these movies fit the bill. The producers wisely highlight not only today's rice-rockets used by kids, but spotlight American Muscle, too.  What's not to like?  This book goes over all the cars of the three movies- and is fairly accurate (I read that the Mustang in the last movie had to have the import motor taken out because it wasn't up to speed, so to speak.  This is not mentioned here, and implies the import motor was used).  Nice photos, nice descriptions, and a nice addition to my Star Cars Library. \n",

This book starts off slowly as it updates you on where the story is so far, but picks up speed nicely as the hero Gaborn leaves on his quest to save mankind.  What is refreshing about this series is that it does not follow in the Wheel of Time mold that a great many authors seem to do.  Some of the logic that Farland includes in his books does not hold up to close scrutiny, and his main characters are not re-introduced in this novel, so I would greatly recommend it for fans of the series, but casual readers should start at the beginning of the series or steer clear of this book.  So, I give it 4 out of 5 sad faced basset hound puppies. \n",

      " review: Ms. Curott's book is rich with much-needed detail: in-depth circle casting, solid foundations and motivation for spellwork, and broadly-defined Wiccan theology.  I would consider \"Witchcrafting\" a worthy addition to the magickal library of anyone who is hungry for a more profound and powerful relationship to the God and Goddess.As many other reviewers have noted, her dismissal of the Threefold Law only goes so far.  I've always viewed the warning in the Rede as a somewhat one-dimensional means of helping lesser-skilled witches resist the obvious temptations of spellwork contrary to \"harm none\".My jaw literally dropped, however, when reading that I and my Wiccan brothers should embrace the Goddess because \"...She restores aspects of men's humanity and divinity [...] sacrificed to an unbalanced and unhealthy conception of masculinity...\"; and, later on, that She offers us all \"sexuality and eroticism that is whole and integrated into the realm of feelings, instead of isolated and objectified in body parts, magazines, porn flicks, one-night stands, and strip clubs.\"At no point does the author make the slightest effort to clarify this sweeping, blatantly sexist stance, nor does she quantify her description of All Men's Failings to exclude those who cannot be so described.  I confess, I had to go to Wikipedia to learn that the gender opposite of misogyny is misandry: the hatred or contempt of men.This totally offensive and appallingly inappropriate gaffe aside, the other 98% of this book is an extremely worthy read; enriching in its content and very well written. \n",

      " review: I love Clif Bars, especially the \"carrot cake\" flavor!  When I saw this book by the CEO and founder of the company, I picked it up right away.  It is always insightful to read about people who founded or run companies and get an inside look at how they built the organization and what they value.  Where most business books focus on financials, strategy and how to be successful in their market, it is rarer to find a company that has been very successful financially while still placing their values as a higher priority than the profit-at-all-costs culture that plagues many organizations.The book describes in detail the founding of the company, from the almost storybook beginnings in his moms kitchen.  What started as a desire to create a \"sports bar\" that didn't taste like dirt, has turned into a quality and well known brand. While these types of rags to riches stories may be sounding familiar, this path is actually quite different.  Gary describes his passions for biking, travel and climbing, and how he has learned to value the environment and focus his company on sustainable growth. When his competitors were becoming part of large conglomerates with the resources to outspend and out market his brand, he resisted the lure of millions to sell the company and chose to remain private.I found myself marking pages, pondering quotes, and admiring the spirit and values that Gary brought to the organization.  He describes the difference between the \"red path\" and the \"white path\".  Developed through an analogy of taking roads less traveled, and traveling light on his numerous bike trips in Europe, he discovers that the real joy is in the journey not the destination. Those who take the \"white path\" play it safe, and make the kinds of business decisions that accountants love.  Those who take the \"red path\" stay true to their values, and must sometimes take risks others would fear to do in order to ensure the vision is upheld.For those who enjoy business strategy, the book contains plenty.  The steps to business sustainability and the values of hiring the right people and creating the right culture for employees are outlined and described.  Also, like Howard Shultz and a few others, Gary chooses to be honest about his doubts, his mistakes, and his fears.  In this way, the book is more inspiring than the typical academic and controlled business planning tools most consultants and business leaders use to replace passion and leadership.I recommend this book highly.  If you feel there is something missing in your company, and the workplace has become an unending and unsatisfying grind, then prepare to be inspired and encouraged.  It is refreshing to know that there are still business leaders who understand that life is more than their balance sheet.  A great example of a company willing to give back to the community and try to make the world a better place.  A company and a leader who not only believe their employees have inherent value as human beings, but treat them as such. \n",

Now the movie, I think they were a little hard on the Oh So Social, and they leave out the part about the jewelled copy of the Rubyait aboard ship and a Mummy aboard not listed in hold because - it was on bridge with the  Captain, and I believe this to be true - she was from Temple of Ay.  To see small children get so involved in this beautiful great ship - this masterpiece, and the mystery of its demise is something to behold in this day and age, when even the Cartoon Channel has become contaminated with a lot of smutty propaganda type \"Adult Cartoons\" now put on this channel by 8 oclock PM.Saddest thing about the Titanic, the truth will never be told.....but there were enough hints there, the music of the Barcarolle and the French Can Can - (Offenbach) - and the main theme song is beautiful, in itself a work of art....Leonardo is over-rated as a star, and I could have done without the 99 year old barefoot Rose - for all in all she was just a little crude to be in the Oh So Social Set that is pictured to be - well not so social when it came to the \"third class Steerage.  And ladies of the day did not use crude language, some of the terms originating in the prisions and labor movement. One thing I noted - and saw for the first time - the duty bound officers aboard, the old \"there is not to question why, there is but to do or die\", for it was obvious the people aboard the Titanic left behind, never thought it would sink as fast as it did...the Captain went down with his ship. It seemed to me they made saints of some sinners, and sinners of some saints - and the Oh So Social returning from Upper Egypt were made to appear as though they were not gentlemen, but a bunch of ruthless,hate the poor robber barons.  This movie was anti our Giants but stop to think - this Giant of a Ship destroyed, and aboard some of America's giants killed as if they had all walked into a trap - even some of the crew made to appear ruthless, etc., which was not true - for in the Radio Room lay the secret to the demise of the Titanic......while this was some type of a propaganda piece it is worth watching - true the script was almost childish and whoever wrote same, should take refresher course in TRUTH ABOVE ALL....but all it all it is a collector's item, and we got a peek of the most beautiful ship in the world - and it made me wonder WHO IS KILLING OUR GIANTS?  This is a great buy ...... \n",

      " review: 4 stars for MacDonald's Phantastes2 stars for Eerdman's Kindle release of the book3 stars as an average of the two scores.George MacDonald's Phantastes is a classic early fantasy novel. As C.S. Lewis mentions in the essay that is included by way of an Introduction, MacDonald's genius was not specifically (nor especially) literary. His prose is somewhat troubled. What excels, however is his imagination and his ability to convey goodness and to make it delightful and even exciting. For that alone, the book is well worth reading.I picked up my paperback version of the book recently and it fell apart in my hands despite only having been read once before, and so I purchased the Kindle version of Eerdman's edition. The reason for choosing their edition as opposed to any of those available in the public domain had to do with deficiencies in the public domain editions. Often enough I found that the German quotes were untranslated and/or suffering from OCR related errors. The text itself was poorly formatted, etc. So I purchased Eerdman's Kindle version of the book believing the text to be in good shape.Unfortunately, Eerdman's merely scanned and OCRd the book and left it filled with OCR artifacts. The numeral \"1\", lowercase \"L\", and uppercase \"i\" may all be confused. Sometimes opening and closing quotation marks are switched. There are a number of words that have been concatenated into a single word. In one case I simply couldn't make out the word, even from the context, and was forced to go back to my frail print copy. Any guesses as to what word is meant by \"rot!y\"? The word should have been \"folly\".Once again a publisher has done a quick job of converting their book to ebook without bothering with an editorial process prior to publication. And they charge full price for it, as well. \n",

      " review: The twelfth century Spanish poet Yehuda Halevi was well-respected during his lifetime, but is better known today for his poetical defense of Judaism called The Kuzari, a book that is admired by so many Jews that numerous rabbis give classes and lectures on it, as if it is a holy book. Unfortunately, neither these rabbis nor their congregants delve deeply enough into the volume to understand it, as Halkin does.Hillel Halkin, an expert on Hebrew literature, is an excellent choice to write about Halevi. Halkin states that very little is known about Halevi's personal life, including when he was born and died, who he married and about his children. The noun \"Halevi\" was not his name; it was applied to all Jews who are Levites, putative descendant of Jacob's son Levi, and means \"The Levite.\" Virtually all that is known about him is drawn from brief often somewhat obscure personal references contained in his poems and some letters, including letters found in 1896 in the Cairo Genizah in Egypt. We know that he was not only a successful poet, but also a physician with a medical practice; but he wrote that he did not like being a doctor and felt that he was not good at it.Halkin spends most of his book discussing Halevi's poetry. He gives many examples of Halevi's non-religious poems on wine, women, and song (such as, \"O swear by Love that you remember days of embraces / As I remember nights crammed with your kisses\"), his religious poems, and his poems about Israel, including his famous poem, whose opening words Halkin translates as, \"My heart in the east, but the rest of me far in the west.\" The well-known line of the famous Israeli song of the 1967 war \"Jerusalem of gold, of copper, and of light, / To all your songs I am a lute\" was taken from Halevi's \"Zion! Do You Wonder?\" Halkin analyses many of the poems and shows how they are constructed. Readers will learn much about poetry from these discussions.Halkin also writes about Spain during Halevi's lifetime, and this will interest people who want to know about this unusual, often turbulent period of Jewish history, the time and place when and where Judaism's greatest philosopher Moses Maimonides (1138-1204) was born.But, Halevi's present-day renown is based on his Kuzari, a fictional account of a rabbi explaining Judaism to a non-Jewish Kuzar king. Halevi subtitled his Kuzari \"The Book of Proof and Demonstration in Defense of the Despised Faith.\" Like his negative opinion about his medical practice, Halevi repudiated his Kuzari in a letter as \"foolishness.\" Halkin suggests that Halevi may have been referring to an early version of this classic, but this is by no means certain because many of the ideas that Halevi offers his readers are difficult if not impossible to accept.Halevi argues in a circular fashion, for example, that Judaism is not based on faith but on historical experience. We know, he insists, that there were six hundred thousand Israelites at Sinai because the Bible tells us so - and we know that the Bible is telling us the truth because six hundred thousand Israelites could not have been wrong. Halkin comments, \"Wasn't Halevi aware, one wonders, of the faultiness of such logic? How could it have failed to occur to him that the biblical account of Sinai...might have been written long after the supposed events took place and been imagined, not by a multitude of Israelites, but by a small number of biblical authors?\"Halevi \"proves\" that free will exists by arguing that we know it exists because we feel that it exists. Halkin states that this \"approach is disappointingly nave.\"But his most radical and outrageous notion, an idea never previously presented by anyone, is that Jews are biologically superior to non-Jews. Non-Jews, he insists, are incapable of fully developing spiritually, even converts to Judaism cannot develop because their biology remains unchanged. Thus, no non-Jew can become a prophet.Halevi took an extremely conservative approach to the divine commandments. Whereas Moses Maimonides, for example, explained that all of the Torah's commands are rational, Halevi insisted that humans are incapable of understanding the divine commandments and they must be obeyed simply because God said so.The Kuzari contains curious discrepancies, For example, Halevi rails against philosophy as being harmful to Judaism, yet he goes to great length to attempt to prove that an ancient Jewish book that he respected Sefer ha-Yetsirah is a philosophical book. Halkin suggests that Halevi extolled philosophy in an early version of the Kuzari, changed his mind, and forgot to edit this part of his volume.Probably the only redeeming factor in the Kuzari is Halevi's argument that Jews should stop waiting for God to restore Israel to the Jewish people; Jews should take matters into their own hands.Harkin compares Halevi's Kuzari to Maimonides' rational Guide of the Perplexed. \"The reader attracted to Maimonides will find The Kuzari irrational in its assumptions, careless in its logic, dismissive of scientific thinking, presumptuously ethnocentric.\"In short, this is an excellent presentation of Halevi's poetry and his radical ideas about Judaism. \n",

      " review: Some months ago I completed a Project Management course for which the textbook was the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) by the Project Management Institute (PMI). As I went through the 9 PM knowledge areas, 5 process groups, 44 processes and the countless tools and techniques in each process, I could not help thinking that something was missing. While the PMBOK does a good job covering project management methodologies, it barely talks about the people skills that Project Managers need for success. Anthony Mersino's \"Emotional Intelligence for Project Managers\" does an excellent job bridging this gap in the discipline of Project Management.This book is broken into four parts. It starts with an introduction to Emotional Intelligence, a term that Mersino defines as \"knowing and managing our own emotions and those of others for improved performance\". The remaining parts deal with Self-management, Building project stakeholder relationships and Using Emotional Quotient (EQ) to lead project teams. To me, the highlight of the book was Mersino's Emotional Intelligence Framework for Project Management This builds upon and customizes (for project management) Daniel Goleman's Framework of Emotional Competencies.The Emotional Intelligence Framework for Project Management has five domains:1. Self-awareness2. Self-management3. Social awareness4. Relationship management5. Team leadershipMersino has over 20 years of project management experience and teaches courses at Northwestern University. Overall, this book is well researched and well presented. In addition, it is an excellent compilation of resources on emotional intelligence for project management. It is a great addition to every Project Manager's book-shelf. \n",

Author, Judy Underwood (PhD), provides guidance to the reader through her experiences assisting one of her clients through the often times bewildering responsibilities involved as one approaces the end of life. While I had already made some preparations for my own eventual death (will, living will, services, remains), this informative book reinforced many of my beliefs involving dying, but it also elicited the need for me to re-evaluate how some things should be better handled. I urge all to take the one or two evenings it takes to read this well organized book on a most important subject that all too many of us try to ignore. \n",

      " review: (I received a complimentary copy of the book in exchange for an honest review)Loves reading books from New Authors that I have never read books from. I came across Rachael Wade on Creative Reviews on Goodreads. Goodreads is one of my FAVE sites that I'm always on. I'm addicted to finding new books and new authors and I'm glad I came across Rachael Wade and her book \"Amaranth\". I had a hard time putting down \"Amaranth\". I was determined to finish the book before the new year got here. Being a Mom of two girls...that goal can sometimes be challenging, but after a night of staying up late and dealing with grogginess the next morning...I finished \"Amaranth\". =)What are some things I enjoyed about this book...the storyline that Rachael writes, the characters, the emotional ride she takes you on, and the ending. A brief description of the book:Poor Camille just wants to get away from her old life. Seems the girl can't catch a break from the bad guys she keeps hooking up with until she meets Gavin in Paris when she's visiting. She never thought though, she would meet him again while she was at work in Louisiana and attending college...but she did. The handsome stranger, Gavin comes into her life and changes her view of what guys should be. She's used to being used and abused by guys...but Gavin teaches her the guys should treat her with respect and love her. What she doesn't know is Gavin has a dark secret and can she handle it if he tells her?Rachael Wade definitely tells you a different side of the Vampires. Not only do they suck blood...but they suck energies, desires, etc.She doesn't copy from other authors about Vampires. She creates her own world and brings back what Vampires are really. I just have to remind everyone that Vampires are not meant to Sparkle and their lethal creatures, just like Rachael writes about in \"Amaranth\". In fact I was scared for the characters when they went to face their Creator. You'll just have to read the book to find out.As far as the characters, I loved Camille and Gavin. They definitely were meant to meet each other. I loved how Rachael takes you through the emotional journey of Camille's life and even Gavin's. It makes you love them more and feel sorry for them.If you love reading a book that brings back what a TRUE Vampire is, you'll enjoy this book. You'll also enjoy the storyline to it.Just a warning, you may not like the cliffhanger at the end. I'm all for cliffhangers. That is what makes a GOOD Trilogy. A book that leaves you begging for more, makes you want to read the next one.I can't wait to read the next book because Rachael definitely leaves you hanging at that end of this book. I was not expecting that cliffhanger. Another good reason why I love Rachael's writing style. I love Authors that throw you off. =)Thank you again, Rachael for giving me the chance to read and review your book. =) \n",

      " review: Bob Roberts, Jr. in his new book , \"Bold as Love book coverBold as Love\" published by Thomas Nelson shows us What Can Happen When We See People the Way God Does.From the back cover:  As Christians, we're called to love our neighbors--all our neighbors. But is that even possible? And can we truly love them well?People often think of their neighbors as those already belonging to their \"tribe\" or community. It's safe, it's easy, and it doesn't often cause conflict--politically or religiously. But in today's world, everyone and everything is interconnected globally in an ever-changing cultural landscape, while religious strife runs rampant. Is it feasible for Christians to live their faith boldly and lovingly while entering into a true relationship with \"neighbors\" of other faiths, both locally and globally?In Bold as Love, Pastor Bob Roberts shows you what it looks like to live out your faith daily in the global public square among people of other faiths--Jews, Muslims, atheists, Hindus, Buddhists. While he admits that it can be challenging to engage people of other faiths whose beliefs are as strong as yours, he demonstrates how to enter into this critical dialogue in a radical yet loving way. \"We have to learn to speak with one conversation and give the same message everywhere to everyone,\" he says. \"We are commanded to love God and love others. And sometimes that requires risky boldness.\"Roberts invites you to respond to this call to live a life of fearless and loving engagement with the world. So take the risk! Your faith wasn't made to live in isolation. It's something you do face-to-face, heart-to-heart, hand-to-hand. Whether you are in a suburb of Houston or a village in India, put away the fear and suspicion and, instead, answer the call to radically love others the way God loves. And get ready to see your life and the lives of those you touch--your family, your community, even your enemies--transformed!I don't know about where you live but where I live the nationalities seem to be expanding.  Within just a few blocks of my home there are Vietnamese, Koreans, Chinese, People from India, Pakistan, Central & Northern Europe as well as the Middle East.  Quite a diversity wouldn't you say?  Leads to a number of new restaurants to try out with lots of new recipes.  This diversity also leads to lots of different religious beliefs in the area.  Is this something to be frightened about?  Should we shun them?  Absolutely not!  We need to embrace them.  How can we learn about anyone unless we make friends?  They may not believe what we believe however they are human just like us and we all need friends.  Shutting people out of our lives only leads to hurt feelings and walls that take a long time to break down.  Bob Roberts, Jr. shows us how to build multifaith communities where we can all get along and live and work together in prosperity and harmony.  \"Bold as Love\" is an eye-opening experience that if taken and used will greatly open and enrich your life and those in your community.  I think you will want to give this book to family and friends so that they can have a new perspective also.  They will always remember your gift and thank you for it.  I recommend this book highly!Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from Handlebar Publishing.  I was not required to write a positive review.

      " review: It's amazing how basic deeds in life an be directives for measures of success. But tying a tie?!  So says author, Antwone Fisher who in his book A Boy Should Know Hot to Tie A Tie, he gives concise and fundamental ways to give common bonds in life with ten  chapters. Even the subtitle, `Other Lessons for Succeeding in Life' gives fair warning for subjective analysis. In reading this essential work, I came away with awe in how he gave poignant, but clear missives in how boys can get ahead, stay there and use a plain structure for maintaining confidence to be what one would aspire to be. He further surmises that, \"the book you (will) hold in your hands is part instruction manual, part guidebook, and part reflection.\" And so it is.As I give you an analogy of this book, please don't be deterred or turned off by the title. There's messages therein that I feel are not only important but sorely needed for all young boys transitioning to responsible men should abide by. These life lessons are artfully displayed in the author reliving his past life as a Navy recruit realizing in retrospect how admiration for his foster father and what was instilled in him the premise for this book. But in assessing the aforementioned, it wasn't until Fisher was enlisted in the military that he realized his detailed-oriented and smartly dressed father had never taken the time to teach him how a first impression was necessary to reflect on the outside the man he needed to become on the inside. This impressionable ideal came to a head when his company commander demanded as a prerequisite that, \"A boy ought to know how to tie a tie.\"  The requirement was the navy's revered half-Windsor knot.The first chapter starts out judicially admonishing the value of self-worth in developing it, learning the tenets of  how materialism can ruin the best laid plans, and finally how relative it is to value anything worth achieving for good results. If value is part of the process to get from here to there, then intuition cannot be ignored in this scheme. It's about making good discernible options for choice to manifest trust and understanding in anticipating deterrents. Chapters three to ten are a cornucopia of different precepts from how to stay groomed, to balancing a budget to developing a plan for life, including inventing/reinventing self and most importantly, creating a spiritual awareness. If the authors intent is to bring a closer edge to boys realizing how identity is apropos for any advancement, he succeeds here as all the \"hints and tips\" portions of this book are very practical, pervasive and presented in clear and helpful ways where a no-nonsense style is evident. I am impressed and duly cognizant of how this book can help any young man coming to grips with self. As such, I feel that this is a MUST read and recommend this book to boys in every echelon of their growing experience and to other young men who may have never had the opportunity to learn these quality living aspects to foment a meaningful existence for self, family and community. Thank you Mr. Fisher for such an insightful and thoughtful book -- it's sorely needed! \n",

      " review: In the title novella of this heartwarming romance collection, Fern Michaels introduces us to Amy Lee, a glamorous movie star bored with her success and her surroundings. Whoever said money can't buy happiness must have been thinking about Amy. All the trappings of her Hollywood lifestyle are unable to soothe her troubled past. As a teenager, her parents were killed in a gas explosion in their home in Apple Valley, Pennsylvania. Amy, known then as Amanda Leigh, was out shopping with her girlfriends when she heard the devastating news. Her Aunt Flo, a travel writer and adventurer in the Auntie Mame variety, quickly swooped in to care for her, and the two moved to southern California in an effort to start fresh. It was here that Amy got into acting and quickly ascended into film stardom. But her fame is simply a bandage on a wound too deep.After suffering through another tedious party at her Malibu beach house, Amy decides to abandon her movie career (at least for the time being) and return to Apple Valley in the hopes of regaining what was lost --- her holiday spirit and a truer sense of happiness and fulfillment. Once there, she runs into her high school boyfriend, Hank Anders, also recently returned to town to spend the holidays with his twin brother Ben, now deployed in Iraq, his wife Alice and their twin infant sons. What he hopes will be a restful holiday is anything but when harried new mother Alice confides in him that she's cracking under the pressure and leaves him in charge of the house and the boys while she takes a few days for herself. Despite the hurdles of their very different lives, Amy and Hank rekindle their old love, and she realizes that you can indeed go home again.In \"Dear Santa,\" mystery writer Holly Berry is lost, both figuratively and literally. On the way to research a new novel, she swerves to miss a deer, and her car plows into a snow bank in the Cascade Mountains of Washington State. Just as she is wondering how many hours she can survive in this blustery cold, she is rescued by Gabriel O'Halloran, local sheriff, innkeeper and proprietor of the Christmas tree farm in the tiny hamlet of Santa's Village, the self-proclaimed \"most Christmassy place on Earth.\" Gabe is a former Marine and single dad to five-year-old Emma, who mistakes Holly as the answer to her Christmas wish for a new mother.Despite her festive name, Holly is not a fan of Christmas. As a matter of fact, she \"hated Christmas. The whole Christmas season. She hated the tinsel, the trappings, the decorated trees, the wrappings, and most of all, she hated Santa Claus, whom she quit believing in when she was seven years old\" after her father was shot and killed by a mugger on Christmas Eve. Despite a move to sunny Los Angeles, Holly has not gotten over it and never feels the desire to celebrate the holiday again. But once ensconced in the cozy town and after spending time with Gabe, Holly is ready to believe again.Photographer and single mother Nicole Piper gets an unwelcome holiday surprise in Mary Burton's \"Christmas Past.\" Nicole has overcome a great deal of anguish over the last year and is determined to put the past behind her and start anew in Richmond, Virginia, with her baby daughter Beth. But her tranquil future is about to be threatened by her violent past. Nicole receives a DVD in the mail and is horrified to learn that it's of her late husband Richard, whose violent and sadistic ways forced her to flee her old life in San Francisco. Back then, she was known as Christine, and after a brief and romantic courtship, she married Richard. Soon her daily nightmare of beatings and threats began. She knew she had to leave, or he would kill her. So she seeks out the help of Claire Carmichael, a woman who aids battered women. With Claire's help, she is able to get out of San Francisco and relocate to Virginia. Watching his face brings it all back, although she tries to reassure herself that Richard is dead and can't hurt her anymore. Or can he?Richard is still trying to control her, even from beyond the grave. In the taped missive, he reveals that he hired someone to kill Claire for helping her escape, and if Nicole will go to his attorney's office in Alexandria, the proof awaits her. As much as she wants to ignore this latest bit of upsetting news, Nicole knows that she must go and get the evidence because a killer has gone free. Maybe after she turns over the information to the police, she can truly get on with her life. Local homicide detective David Ayden insists on accompanying her. David, a widowed father of two boys, has harbored a crush on Nicole for the past year, but senses that she's not ready to trust a man again. In an attempt to do the right thing, Nicole and David find themselves in the crosshairs of a hired killer bent on carrying out her late husband's last wish.Trying to start anew is also a prevalent theme in Judy Duarte's \"A Mulberry Park Christmas.\" Mac Maguire has no intentions of settling down on Sugar Plum Lane, but fate has other ideas. A San Diego homicide detective, Mac recently inherited his old partner's ramshackle Victorian home on the quaint street in his hometown of Fairbrook, but his only intention was to flip the house as soon as possible and get back to his life in the city.Enter Jillian Grant, his old high school flame, recently divorced and back in town with her two young children. Mac sees poor Jillian struggling with the aftershocks of a bad marriage and tries to help her remember all the fond memories they shared, especially around the holidays. They became close all those years ago at the first annual Mulberry Park Christmas celebration, and this year Mac feels that Jillian needs to experience the joy of the season more than ever. And in his heart of hearts, he realizes he probably does too. For the first time in a very long time, Mac remembers the words a kindly old homeless man once told him: \"If you choose to do right over wrong, every chance you get, you'll get that family you always wanted and reap the kind of life you deserve.\" Mac is ready to claim that life he's dreamed about for so long --- and he wants to share it with Jillian and her children.The four novellas featured in SILVER BELLS each demonstrate a renewed sense of Christmas spirit. With the economy in shambles, wars being waged overseas, and the destructive nature of death and divorce ever present, who couldn't use a gentle reminder of the finer aspects of the holiday?

      " review: I have used a scanner in the past to obtain fault codes but was frustrated by some of the code descriptions not really describing the source of the problem.  This book is a really straightforward explanation of what OBDII really is, how it works and what the codes really mean.  The author has obviously spent a great deal of time teaching this subject and he leads the reader from simple principles all the way through to a real understanding of how the sensors and components work together and how the computer checks to see that the emission system is performing as it should.  All the individual emission system functions are described along with real examples of the diagnosis of faults.  Monitors, what they are and how to interpret the enabling criteria to ensure they run to completion.  The use of mode 5 & 6 for diagnosis is also explored.If you are an beginner or an experienced mechanic who needs to expand your knowledge then this book is for you. \n",

      " review: As a victim of school bullying in the 1980s, I can relate to Jodee's story. Kids can be cruel and I know from experience that acts of violence occur in schools more often than teachers or parents would like to admit. Kids often don't tell their parents when they are being bullied. Professionals may offer useless suggestions that make the problem worse. Like Jodee, I was told to \"just ignore\" the kids who would regularly tease me. And, as in Jodee's experience, this didn't make the problem go away. Jodee's accounts of being beaten, spit upon, burned, and teased hit close to home for me, and I was often in tears while I was reading this book. There were several instances when I felt like Jodee was telling my own story.Having said that, I wish Jodee had added some mature insight. We all gain perspective as we grow older, but this book is written almost entirely from the teenaged Jodee's perspective. A quick chapter at the end of the book expresses the adult Jodee's point of view all too briefly. Without the benefit of hindsight, Jodee comes off as a bit saintly. She seems to have been the only perfect child at any school she attended. I wondered if, 20 years later, she still feels that way.I also longed for a little more insight into why Jodee quested for popularity. After my bullying experience, I tried to fade into the background with a small and solid group of friends - a strategy that, for the most part, worked extraordinarily well. As a reader, I would cringe each time Jodee became a part of the A-list at a new school. I would have appreciated some hindsight on why Jodee felt such a need to be popular. Near the end of the book, Jodee did find true friends who appreciated who she really was. Knowing why it took her so long to do so would have added some extra depth that could have helped me understand Jodee as a person, rather than as a victim.Jodee also doesn't offer any solutions on how to end or blunt the pain of school bullying. Jodee was bullied because she stood up for the underdog, which is noble. But what about kids who are bullied simply because they are different? An acknowledgment of, and a workable strategy for, all kinds of kids would would have been appreciated. Co-writing this book with a psychologist or expert on teen behavoir would have also added a much-needed second point of view.Even with these criticisms, I do recommend this book. Jodee's writing style is simple and direct, and she tells her story in an engaging manner. This is an absorbing read and tells an important story. Stories like Jodee's need to be heard. I hope her book will be read by school faculty and administrators, parents whose kids are victims of bullying, and parents who believe thier kids would \"never bully anyone.\" I also hope Jodee will inspire more former victims to tell their stories. We need to have a national conversation about bullying and what we can do to prevent it. \n",

      " review: Author Susie Kelly does it again. This is a book that, characteristically for Ms. Kelly, blends historical, cultural and geographical fact with an hilarious account of a very modern expedition. Following in the footsteps of the legendary Queen of France, Susie and her husband Terry attempt to do their historical research by bicycle...no mean feat for an untrained cyclist, especially in the crazy streets of Paris!I won't tell you the story(you need to read it for yourself, believe me) but what I will say is that this is a book to cherish. Prepare to learn things you never dreamed of knowing, to laugh, to cry, to empathise (with Susie's physical discomforts as much as with Marie Antoinette's tragedy!) and above all, to enjoy this trip around the France of yesterday and also of today from the comfort of your armchair...or deckchair, should you be lucky with the weather while reading! Ms. Kelly's easy writing style is accessible to all, her descriptions vivid, her observations sharp and her wit and wisdom as engaging as ever.There are a million and one reasons to read this book. Read it if you love France, if you are interested in history, in amateur cycling, in human relationships or if you just want to lose yourself in a fantastic read. \n",

      " review: A received a review copy of this book courtesy of the publisher via Netgalley in exchange for my honest opinion.Let me start by saying that I probably wouldn't have picked this book up had Netgalley not invited me to read it, however it was very readable, compulsively so!While the last book I read by this author duo, Between You & Me, was very reminiscent of the life of Britney Spears, The First Affair made me think about the Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky affair. While I was only in my early teens when the news of the Clinton-Lewinsky affair broke, it is obviously a highly publicized case so of course I was familiar with many aspects of the case...enough to see too many similarities to Jamie McAlister and President Gregory Rutland in this fictitious account.Obviously the Clinton-Lewinsky affair is a huge moment in not only U.S. history but World history, and in years to come I'm sure it will still be spoken about, and I'm also fully aware that many authors get inspiration from real world events, BUT and it's a BIG BUT...I think a different spin could've been put on it rather than The First Affair being almost a carbon copy of Lewinskygate.The saving grace for me was reading about Jamie's difficult childhood, living with an alcoholic father and living in the shadows of an older sister (Erica) who inherited the same addictive personality. Growing up in a volatile middle-class environment, Jamie seems to have craved attention from older male figures - apparent when we are introduced to a character from her past - to make up for the love and affection her father was unable to offer. This background offered an insight into how and why a person such as Jamie could be so naive and needy of attention. It's just an unfortunate series of events that led her to a huge mistake.After reading Between You & Me, I just felt that this followed the same formula in that the main characters and events are based on extremely familiar real life people and events. Also at times it felt as though the two different writing styles of the authors was quite obvious and this interrupted the flow for me. It was hard for me to only rate The First Affair 3 out of 5 as I really do like the authors, and overall I did enjoy the book but there were just too many flaws for me to group it with some of the other books I rated 4 out of 5 so far this year. I would still recommend this book to other readers, especially those looking for an easy summer read. \n",

      " review: The operative word is SHORT, not easy. No hike, according to the author's calculations, takes more than 2.5 hours; seven take less than a half hour. Although a number of the hikes covered are really just strolls, such as at Sprague and Lily Lakes, several offer more challenge because of elevation increases. Remember, for the most part you are starting out at 8500 feet or more: mouth breathing territory for many folks.Although this is a slender booklet (easy to take along), there are good tips for health, safety, and comfort. A map of the park and its immediate surrounds is a useful partner to the clear instructions about reaching trailheads. Aerial photos of each trail and the \"step by step\" guide provide a succinct, but sufficiently thorough, introduction to each trail.I have a number of books about hiking in Rocky Mountain National Park and would be reluctant to name any as the best. But this is one I consider indispensible, especially for helping our visitors find interesting and satisfying experiences in a magnificent setting. If you are lucky enough -- as we are -- to live near the park, you will want a variety of guides, including this one. If you will visit only a day or two, this may be a good, inexpensive choice for enriching your time there. \n",

      " review: Ben H. Winters, &lt;strong>Bedbugs&lt;/strong> (Quirk Books, 2011)Full disclosure: this book was provided to me free of charge by Amazon Vine.Okay, a topical (read: this will be dated in five years) horror novel from a guy listed as a New York Times bestseller? I bit without doing my research, which ended up being annoying. I had my suspicions when I saw Quirk as the publisher, and then the author description confirmed my worst fears: \"Ben H. Winters is the New York Times bestselling author of &lt;em>Sense and Sensibility and Sea Monsters&lt;/em>...\" Lord save us from this current classic novel-monster movie mashup fad, which is getting more idiotic every month. But still, I loved the jacket copy on this, which made it sound like a weird mix of &lt;em>Rosemary's Baby&lt;/em> and &lt;em>The Sentinel&lt;/em>, two of my favorite cheesy horror novels, so I dove in. And while no one will ever confuse Ben Winters with Jeffrey Konvitz, &lt;em>Bedbugs&lt;/em> delivers nicely.I do not know Ben Winters, nor do I know anything about his life, but I'm going to take a few guesses: he's about my age (early forties), maybe a few years younger, and he grew up on a steady diet of crappy horror novels during the Golden Age of the seventies and eighties. I say this because &lt;em>Bedbugs&lt;/em>, while definitely a contemporary book (and as influenced by Bret Easton Ellis as by anything Golden Age--please, authors, I beg you, quit with the product placement...), is very much informed not only by Levin and Konvitz, but by any number of others the true crap-horror buff will recognize from back in the day--Helen McCloy, Rick Hautala, Ken Eulo, I think I may have even caught a slight whiff of early Joy Fielding, who was writing pulp horror novels before she made it big in the thriller world. (Specifically, I'm thinking of &lt;em>The Transformation&lt;/em>, which if you're a Fielding fan and you haven't read, you should be spending every available moment trying to hunt down.) And I grant you, authors that blend up old influences and regurgitate them onto the page are a dime a dozen, but as I said back in paragraph one, there's no point in this book at which Winters would be mistaken for any of them. He's pulled out all the old horror tropes and dragged them kicking and screaming into the twenty-first century, and it's about bloody time someone did.Plot: ex-lawyer Susan Wendt, who left behind her stressful, high-paying corporate job to return to her art, is looking for a new apartment. She has a husband and a daughter, but they're more important as plot points than as characters. (This is the book's weakest aspect; the minor characters are there for the sole purpose of advancing Susan, Louis the handyman, and Andrea the landlord on the narrative path.) She finds the oldest horror trope in the book: a gorgeous two-floor space in Red Hook, which, okay, is losing property values by the minute right now but is still in Brooklyn fergossake, for a steal. Turns out it's the top two floors of a converted house owned by Andrea, a slightly crazy old lady whose husband shuffled off this mortal coil a few years before. Andrea has a pal named Louis who does the handiwork. He's less crazy than Andrea, but still a little cocked, if you get my drift. In any case, Susan falls in love with the place, immediately latches onto Andrea as a mother figure, and within days her family has moved into the place. All well and good, except that the current bedbug craze has swept through Brooklyn like wildfire. Everyone's talking about bedbugs. It's enough to make a person think they have bites when the best exterminator in town tells you you don't have them. And your husband and kid have no bites. It's even enough to make you think that maybe the bugs are supernatural in origin, and they're specifically targeting you...I have to admit, the first hundred-ish pages of this book had me wanting to pound my head against the wall. I've already mentioned the annoying product-placement stuff, though in a book this topical that's less of a problem; once people stop obsessing over bedbugs, this book is probably headed for the remainder outlets of bookstore chains, so one doesn't have to worry as much about the brand names one uses suddenly no longer existing if someone picks up the novel thirty years later (a major problem for younger readers of Stephen King novels these days, one thinks). And it's slow, slow, slow. Winters doesn't really start ramping up the tension until the family gets into the new place, and even then, he keeps it low-key until Susan's obsessions start getting her into the supernatural/crazy realm, at which point Winters shakes off the fetters, kicks out the jams, and sends this book into full-on seventies-crap-horror mode. At which point it becomes a real treat if you remember the subgenre, or if you're younger and have discovered it after the fact (hard to do considering how much of it is out of print these days, but there are great old used bookstores that can feed your habit for years. You may have to drive twelve hours to find one, but it's worth it...). Once you've fit the book into that framework, it all makes sense.I also have to give Winters points for not going completely off the rails with the ending. Obviously I can't really discuss what happens without major spoilers, but I'm not talking about the events so much as I am the atmosphere. In today's horror culture, this book would probably have been an easier sell if Winters went with an Eli Roth-esque ending (buckets of fake blood, etc.) instead of sticking with the seventies horror formula. But he did, and at least to me, that made a huge difference in how I saw the book as a whole; Winters obviously has a great affection for, and loyalty to, pulp horror, and in turn, that gave me a greater affection for, and loyalty to, &lt;em>Bedbugs&lt;/em>. I hope this book isn't nearly as vertical-market as I think it is, and I hope even more that it grows a passion for those out-of-print pulp classics in a whole new generation of readers. Give it a shot. ***  \n",

      " review: This book made me angry.  And it should make you angry as well.  The title \"Merchants of Doubt\" comes from the same line from a tobacco company executive used in a similar book that came out a couple of years ago that I recently reviewed (Doubt is Their Product).  The basis, first used by the tobacco industry many years ago, was that their goal was to \"manufacture doubt\" in the minds of the public and policy-makers so that no policy-making action would occur, or at least so that it should be delayed as long as possible.  And the tobacco industry succeeded for decades after they themselves knew that tobacco/nicotine was addictive and caused cancer.  Yet they carried on a well-funded campaign to confuse and disinform the public.Naomi Oreskes and Erik Conway are science historians.  And what they have uncovered with this book should shock even those who are familiar with some of the tactics used by the professional denialist industry.  What is even more shocking is how just a handful of scientists and their collaborators have had a hand in nearly every major science denial episode for the last 40 years.  And in the center of it all is the George C. Marshall Institute, Fred Seitz, S. Fred Singer, and the lesser known but equally deceptive William Nierenberg and Robert Jastrow.After the tactics were perfected in the fight to deny that smoking causes cancer, these handful of men with close ties to the Reagan and conservative ideologies employed them over and over again to deny smokestack emissions cause acid rain, CFCs cause ozone depletion, second hand smoke cause cancer in non-smokers, and greenhouse gas emissions cause global warming.  In all cases the science has been right, and this group of men helped delay action for many years until even their deceit couldn't hide the truth.And those tactics, repeated to deny the science in each of these issues, were all the same: employ a few scientists willing to shill for the industry or who are \"skeptical\" (to create the illusion of credibility), focus the efforts through well-funded right wing think tanks (to create the illusion of independence), create \"new\" science specifically designed to create uncertainty (i.e., not to answer questions, but to create contrasting data they can misrepresent), hyperventilate about how \"the science is not settled\" (knowing that science is never settled, but the public won't understand), and of course, using their PR skills, Frank Luntz wordsmithing, and punchy - though meaningless - catchphrases like \"sound science\" to make it sound like they are saying something when they are not saying anything.What I found amazing was how the origins of the George C. Marshall Institute and all of its subsequent science denialism came out of the cold war fight against communism.  These handful of scientists were atomic bomb builders and astrophysicists who had no expertise in any of the science they were denying.  But they had connections, most notably with the Reagan administration and the Strategic Defense Initiative (Star Wars) for which the George C. Marshall Institute was started to sell to the public, the military, and the conservative legislators they were trying to influence.  Yet despite this lack of any expertise they continued to insert themselves into the acid rain debate, the CFC debate, the second hand smoke debate, and the climate change debate.  And each and every time their goal was to push the denial of the science.  They equated environmentalism with communism (\"green on the outside, red on the inside\").  And using their lobbying skills and influence they were able to create the impression that there was still a raging debate in the science, even though in all cases the science was overwhelming and they represented a very minority opinion.  Actually, in all cases they were not being scientists at all, but rather advocates for non-action (all of these men had long-since stopped doing actual research, and none of them had ever done research in the areas of science they were denying).What is most disturbing is that they routinely employed unscientific methods and deceit to push their political views.  These handful of men have almost single-handedly cost the lives of thousands of Americans and increased the cost to taxpayers millions or even billions of dollars through their denial of the science.  Most egregious in this has been S. Fred Singer.  First as a denier that smoking caused cancer, then as a denier that CFCs caused ozone depletion, and now as a denier of climate change, Singer has used despicable methods to deceive fellow scientists who were too slow to realize that such deceit was possible from one of their own.  What he did to Roger Revelle on his death bed is disgraceful.  What he did to Justin Lancaster is despicable.  What he and others did to Ben Santer is just one more example showing that the denialist industry, led by these few men and paid for by the biggest industries on the planet, will go to no end to deny any science or destroy any scientist in their path.  The recent attacks on climate scientists like Michael Mann and Phil Jones are the latest iterations in the denialist industry's tactics.And according to Oreskes and Conway, the denialist industry isn't even satisfied denying the present and the future, they have also recently turned to denying the past.  You may have heard parroted from people here that the banning of DDT by environmentalists has killed millions of people in Africa.  Not true.  But the denialist industry has decided it needs to deny ALL science, and that means going back to the 1960s to attack Rachel Carson, whose book \"Silent Spring\" documented the dangers of widespread pesticide spraying.  DDT was banned in the US after it was discovered that it caused the thinning of eggshells in raptors like our national symbol, the Bald Eagle.  But like all the other denialist attacks, the idea that the US ban cost lives in Africa is completely false.  DDT use actually increased in Africa after it was banned in the US, and in fact is still used today.  It just doesn't work any more because the mosquitoes it is supposed to kill gained resistance to it, in part because of the overspraying advocated by the manufacturers to sell more product.  But this is just one more case where facts are tossed aside in favor of an ideological promotion of an anti-science agenda designed to further the profit of the few at the expense of the many.Oreskes and Conway end their book with \"A New View of Science,\" which I'll let people read for themselves.  And they should.  In fact, they must.  This book must be on the reading list of anyone and everyone interested in science, so they can read for themselves how just a handful of unscrupulous scientists with deep political connections and a near religious anti-communism fervor have been at the heart of every denial of science in the last several decades.  As I indicated to open this review, the book made me angry.  And we should be angry.  And then we should not let them get away with it any longer. \n",

      " review: If you've spent time and effort online and in the Nikon manuals you already know that they explain how the settings work but not why.  As we all shoot different subjects and have preferences and requirements as to metering modes on different shoots, there are a lot of questions as to which is the best setting for each situation.  I use Photoshop in post-production; my settings will be different than yours. If you do not use a powerful post software, my settings will be different than yours.  I shoot fast-moving subjects; my settings will be different than yours if you shoot only landscapes. I basically shoot a Nikon D3X and D3 but help my brother with his D300.  These are powerful tools you don't want to randomly mess-around with when you determine your best settings.  At some point, out of curiosity, I wasted two weeks playing around with possibilities on my three, awesome, factory default-set cameras, only to be a bit confused in the end.  I even found a reviewer online named \"Ken X\" who's suggestions are outlandish!  Most photographers don't even know what their own settings are, leaving everything at \"default\" that Nikon has installed into this powerful equipment.  As such, you will get wonderful shots left as is, but you will miss so much of the potential you hold in your hands.  This book is unbelievably simple and precise to understand, with not only what the settings do, but why, and what is suggested for each metering method, and when.  I recommended getting into the habit of referring to the manual on my website, which is better than nothing, but ultimately the information in the manual leaves a lot of guesswork on your part, more so if you're not familiar with digital camera/photography lingo, but I'm going to change that recommendation to \"Read the Magic Lantern\" books by photographer Simon Stafford.  You won't learn this information in the field or in school.  My circle of friends include many famous working and retired Cinematographers who are still stuck on film because they don't understand digital (or want to) until they see it in action.  Even they need to rethink how digital works compared to their film knowledge.  Finally, not everyone has the years of working in Photoshop that others  may have; this is a big drawback as all shooting needs post production.  The \"LAB\" has always been paramount in the final outcome of a shoot. The Dark Room is still as important today as it ever was, but now it's in the camera settings and in software such as Photoshop.  I'm sharing a treasure of information with you in this review if you're really into digital photography.  If you've ever remarked, \"How do they get those incredible shots?\", then you need to consider how important it might be to start with your camera.  Without knowing how to set it, you've settled for a mediocre  asset to your talent as an artist. \n",

      " review: I enjoyed this exploration of wolf domination and devotion when challenged by a feral cougar.  While not quite as enticing to me as the first Northern Shifters story, the awkwardness and heat between a submissive wolf and a trapped cat kept my attention and interest.  The characters were unique and developed enough to both keep me entertained as well as to care about their fate.  I enjoyed the hint of the struggle within Bram between his pack role and his desire, and would have liked to see even more of the omega's dilemmas explored.  The character of alpha Trey, carried over from the first book in the series,Marked, becomes a little less hidden but with hints of entanglements and plots yet to come.  I'm looking forward to reading more in this series. \n",

      " review: I feel deeply grateful for the book, The Power of Everyday Missionaries by Clayton Christensen. In the May 2003 General Conference, Elder Henry B. Eyring commented as follows:\"A few years ago I spoke to the missionaries in the training center in Japan. I promised them then that a great day would dawn in that nation. I said that there would be a great increase in the members speaking eagerly to those they met of their testimony of the restored gospel. My thought then was that the courage to speak would come from an increased admiration for the Church in that land. I know now that the great miracle, a mighty change, will come inside the members, not in the world around them.\"They and members across the earth will love and listen and talk and testify out of changed hearts. Bishops and branch presidents will lead them by example. The harvest of souls will be great, and it will be safe in the Lord's hands.\"As a three time missionary to Japan, the last two with my wife, I gained a testimony that these words by then Elder Erying were true. I arranged to have three things related to sharing the gospel previously published by Clayton Christensen translated into Japanese to share with leaders and members of the Church in Japan. They are posted on the Japan Church website. These translations have stimulated a stronger interest in sharing the gospel in Japan among members there.Now, it appears more translation needs to be done. I have sent a copy of this new book to the Japanese leader in Japan who led the effort to make a video about members sharing the gospel. He is anxious to get the book. Perhaps not everything in the book will be exactly applicable to Japan, but I believe the principles taught are applicable.I quote from the book's introduction: \"I have spent a large portion of my life working to build the kingdom of God through missionary work---and in so doing have worked hard to understand what God told Isaiah: `For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways' (Isaiah 55:8). ..\"Many of us know people who seem to be \"natural missionaries,\" almost as if they have an innate gift that makes sharing the gospel easy for them. My wife, Christine, and I certainly are not naturals at this. We found the work uncomfortable and intimidating at the outset, which I recognize in retrospect was because we were following many of the thoughts and ways of man.\"Now I add from the Epilogue: \"The choice to cobble together this book of stories from my own life and the lives of those I know well was a hard one because I have tried very hard to stay out of life's spotlight. But I adopted this approach because I wanted to describe not just what I've learned about sharing the gospel, but how I have learned, little by little, about the thoughts and ways of God.\"In my opinion, this is by far the best book I have ever read about sharing the gospel. I have bought and shared several copies and will buy more in the future. The more it is read, I expect this book to make a significant difference, not only in the growth of the Church, but also in the retention of those who choose to accept and live the Gospel.I am trying to learn and practice the principles in this book. If I love God, I must also love what He loves. And He loves His children, all of them. And if I have a testimony, I must share what I know with those I love. And to do it well, I must do it under His guidance. This book helps me much in this effort.  Wade W. Fillmore \n",

      " review: The author Robert Page may call himself an \"Ordinary Joe\" but he is clearly also a very wise and intelligent man.This slim easy to read book is a very personal and brave account of Page's own journey through alcoholism as he found healing through being \"born above\" to the light of Jesus.\"Wounds of the soul are among the most infectious of human sufferings; the most difficult to diagnose accurately; the most difficult to cure,\" he writes. Best of all he understands the ultimate paradox of the healing strength to be found in exposing his own vulnerability and brokenness and pain. \"For when I am weak I am strong,\" wrote St Paul, he reminds us, to the Corinthians.Whilst he stresses that this is not any attempt at self- analysis, nonetheless he recognizes from his upbringing the lack of real parental love as pivotal. Love for his family meant duty, it was conditional, and fed feelings of guilt and rejection, and low self esteem, and left him ill equipped for adulthood.In spite of this he does not hold them responsible, and it is his approach to his parents in the depths of his addiction, when he tells them \"I need help\" that is his turning point towards healing.Page also knows what triggered his crises, and writes of those stages in his life when he felt God's presence in those others who were there for him.Here is a man who now knows his Bible intimately, and is able to weave his own insights from the knocks he has received into its passages, particularly the teaching of Jesus in the Gospels. He discusses the material world and his relation to it, the Golden Rule of unconditionally loving others as oneself, the healing power of forgiveness from the heart, and most of all the love and teaching of Jesus, through which he gains wisdom and spiritual maturity, all enabled through the Grace of God. The words of the Gospels need, he emphasizes, an understanding that is spirit-revealed, not just intellectual. Religion, he tells us, must be felt not learnt, and is for every day, not just a once a week ritual. And if we do not recognize God yet he urges us to listen and watch and don't miss His Presence when He calls.This is a thoughtful book and the author is well able to use his own life's experiences to impart a sincere message to us all. Most certainly it is not just another \"misery memoir.\" I think this book holds wise messages of faith for us all to heed and could be usefully discussed in small church groups to good effect. \n",

      " review: Anyone who even lightly peruses my blog knows that I am a big fan of \"The Webinar Minute\", a video series hosted by Lee Salz, CEO of Business Expert Webinars. Lee bases this series on the ideas presented in his new book \"Stop Speaking for Free! The Ultimate Guide to Making Money with Webinars\".Now I thought I was quite knowledgeable about webinars and I always viewed the production process as pretty straightforward. Lee's book at once daunted me and comforted me. On the daunting side is just how much one has to think about when launching an AFW (an acronym coined by Lee that stands for Attendee Funded Webinar). On the comforting side, Lee leaves nothing to chance. Every nuance of launching an AFW is covered.The first hurdle Lee guides you over is busting the myth that you are doomed to offer your webinar for free. We've all attended so many free webinars that it is easy to assume no one will pay for one. Lee's first lesson for us is that the boundary between free and fee is content. There is content people will pay for. Lee spells out what distinguishes pay worthy content.Then, using his extensive background in sales, Lee teaches you how to put virtual butts in seats. It isn't sufficient to just have good content. You have to sell it. Lee devotes a good portion of the book to crafting your webinar invitation. This invitation should spell out what tangible benefit your audience will reap from your webinar and why you are uniquely suited to deliver it.Lee understands that the new marketing paradigm is inbound and how social media plays a key role in your AFW marketing plan. He devotes a full chapter to using LinkedIn to market yourself and your webinars.So you've got your content and you know how to sell it. Two things can still sink your webinar. First, what technology are you going to use (e.g. Webex, Adobe Connect, omNovia)? Second, how does your actual presentation, the PowerPoint pitch that you're going to use, convey your content? If either is mediocre, your webinar is toast. But Lee has you covered there also. He discusses the factors you need to consider in choosing technology. Then he lets his colleague Susan Stoen write a \"guest chapter\" on making sure your presentation optimally conveys your content. Her guidance on the proper balance between words (or bullet points) and graphics is right on the money. I have one minor quibble with her in that she mentions Apple's Keynote product without telling the reader just how hard it is to use Keynote for webinars. I have not found a single webinar product that can handle native Keynote presentations, so they must either be translated to PowerPoint or broadcast in screen sharing mode out of the native Keynote product. The latter approach is not possible for some webinar platforms that don't allow screen sharing on a MAC.My only other quibble with Lee's book is a self serving one! In discussing webinar platforms, Lee highlights that some webinar platforms come with technical staff who will moderate your webinar for you. Lee neglects to mention that there are independent webinar producers like me who will do the same thing! Maybe Lee will give us independents a nod in his next edition?Overall, Lee has written a comprehensive guide book to giving AFW's, with no fluff and all actionable material. To supplement the excellent contents of the book, Lee provides private access to a web site with additional materials that help you act on his instruction.The bottom line: in this tough economy, why go to the poor house when you can stop speaking for free? \n",

      " review: Werner Herzog's film Fitzcarraldo depicts a man's grueling journey towards self-fulfillment and personal dreams.  Burden of Dreams tells the story from behind the camera, as Herzog finds himself in an almost five-year long struggle to accomplish a dream that nearly broke him physically, psychologically, socially, and economically in the Peruvian jungle.  Despite the many obstacles, Herzog eventually managed to create a brilliant cinematic experience, which now can impress present and future film aficionados.  Yet, before viewing this documentary, the audience should consider two notions that support the idea of viewing Fitzcarraldo first.  First, the final product raises the awareness of why Herzog pursues making the film, which also helps learning from the filmmaking journey.  Second, this documentary would spoil Fitzcarraldo, as it depicts and explains several scenes from the film. It ultimately would reduce the element of surprise and drama.An interesting retrospective notion that comes to mind after the film is the comparable similarities that Herzog has with Fitzcarraldo who is the character that Klaus Kinski portrays in the film.  They both have the desire to fulfill a dream to the level of obsession where both seem willing to risk it all in their endeavor.  Herzog even mentions in the documentary, \"I live my life, or I end my life with this project.\"  This also suggests why Herzog believes that the film had to be done, as it provides a strong reflection of Herzog's own persona and his existential philosophy.Often the journey of reaching a dream drifts into oblivion when the aftermath surfaces.  On the other hand, Burden of Dreams makes sure that the audience does remember the importance of the struggle for dreams through Herzog's numerous predicaments.  For example, his initial problems include border wars, death threats, and the departure of leading role actors, which consequently makes investors nervous.  After having been set back for over a year Herzog commences the shooting of Fitzcarraldo, as difficulty continues to haunt the filming with drought, tribal war, and a plane crash.  He even believes that a curse rests over the film production.  All of these delays begin to have their toll on him and the rest of the filmmaking crew, as he begins to drift into an angry gloominess blaming the ever so close jungle.All of the negative impacts that the film crew and cast experience are intensified by the Amazon jungle that surrounds them for thousands of miles.  Originally, Herzog believed that isolation from civilization would bring out qualities in both the cast and crew that would heighten the cinematic experience.  This concept had more validity than Herzog would ever have anticipated, as boredom begins to affect both the crew from the modern world and the natives who live by ancient traditions.  Steadily morale keeps on sinking.  Fortunately, a cure to the low morale rests within down-to-earth solutions.  Yet, through the problems and the solutions Herzog begins to see the dark nature of the unforgiving jungle that seems to come closer and closer.The director Les Blank objectively captures the clash between ancient and modern traditions, as the natives and the film crew interact in the tropical rainforest.  The audience gets to observe the making of the traditional masato, an alcoholic beverage made of yuca chewed and fermented with human saliva.  There is a also a scene in Fitzcarradlo where Kinski is supposed to drink masato to seal an agreement between him and the natives, but in fear of infection, Kinski avoids it by drinking canned milk.  Despite the troubles, the camera effortlessly flows with the fatigued crew of Europeans, Americans, and natives, as they all have to endure the burden of Herzog's dream - Fitzcarraldo.Previous documentaries such as American Movie (1999) and Lost in La Mancha (2002) offer similar experiences, but they do not achieve the anxiety that Burden of Dreams reaches.  The forcefulness of the story rests within the topic, which in this case is Herzog and his desire to fulfill his dream.  In many aspects, this documentary seems outlandish such as Herzog's idea of pulling a steamboat over a mountain and the abundance of problems that surrounded the making of Fitzcarraldo.  Yet, it is within this madness, if you will, where Blank captures the power of dreams in a similar way that the bird Phoenix raises from the ashes. \n",

I'm no expert on video, but I think some folks are being a little picky.  These programs were produced over 20 years ago for TV.  The exteriors were done on 16mm film and the interiors were done on video tape.  This was not a theatrical release.  It looks to me like some work has been done on the shows, as they look and sound better than any PBS broadcast that I've seen.The extras are great, with the exception of the first 6 commentaries by John Howard Davies.  It sounds as if Davies hasn't viewed these for years and remembered very little.  As a result, most of these commentaries consist of a lot of heavy breathing, sniffing, and slurping. He makes a comment about every 5 or 10 minutes on average. Still, Davies' noises can be amusing, especially at 3 in the morning! The last 6 commentaries by Bob Spiers are much better.  Spiers does far more talking and actually seems to have some memory of the shows he directed.  It would have been nice if the BBC had offered John Cleese a big pile of money to do commentaries for these shows.  Eric Idle was once quoted as saying that Cleese would do anything for money - He once offered him a pound to shut up &amp; Cleese took it!  Cleese probably would have done a commentary...for a price.The interviews on the discs are great.  Each disc contains a different interview with John Cleese, which are about 20 minutes each.  Disc 2 has an interview with Andrew Sachs who was Manuel. The interview is nearly a half hour and Sachs is very witty and entertaining.  Disc 3's interview with Prunella Scales (Sybil Fawlty) is good, but very short.There are also a couple of great documentaries: One about the Gleneagles Hotel &amp; Donald Sinclair who Fawlty Towers &amp; Basil Fawlty are based, as well as a brief featurette about the building that acted as the exterior for Fawlty Towers and the fire that destroyed the building in the 1990's.  There are also about 5 minutes or so of mildly amusing outtakes.So, sit back have a Kipper or a Waldorf Salad and enjoy some great comedy.  Just don't mention the war! \n",

      " review: Since the first Windham Hill Records Guitar Sampler is arguably the best collection of music that Windham Hill has every relased, it could only be hoped that the second sampler would at least be just as good. The truth is that there is a bit of a sophomore slump, and my 4 stars is actually a 3.5 rounded up. The album itself is OK but no songs stand out like the first edition. The best songs on this album are the ones by Michael Hedges and Alex deGrassi. I know every song on the first sampler, but not many on this one...and I had this album for a longer time than I did the first sampler. Get it on the cheap is my advice. \n",

It revolved around a guy who had a live cable cooking show, on which Jeni was heard to say lines like, \"You know it's time to change the box of Arm and Hammer in your refrigerator when, if you reach for the broccoli, it reaches back....the hand on the Arm and Hammer box is giving you the finger.....,\" etc.  What a shame that he killed himself!  He was truly a funny man, and this CD proves it.  One of my favorite lines is in \"Something You Never Hear.\"  Then there's the shoe salesman story, and Jacques Cousteau.....uproariously funny.

Alot of times Led Zep IV falls down on the list because it is called many different names (IV , 4, Untitled, Ruins, ZOSO, Symbols, Pealing Paint On Building). Most The Jeff Beck Group fans don't like this album because before it came out TJBG fans felt that TJBG was the better G. Then this album came out and the world changed. It knocked The Beatles Abbey Road off the top of the charts and maybe toward thoughts of retirement. AM radio began playing Whole Lotta Love along with every inch of Robert Plant's love. Guitar solos, squeezing lemons, drum solos, juices running and questions about what is and what should never be filled the album's grooves with sounds that still amaze new listeners.If you plan on dying with more than $10 in the bank, use it now to buy this album.If you have some more, get Led Zep 4 and Physical Graffiti as well. \n",

      " review: If you think the horror spoof comedy genre started with Scary Movie and Shriek if You Know What I Did Last Friday the Thirteenth, think again.  Horror was all the rage in the early 1980s (as the introduction to this film points out, all 26 horror movies released during the previous year made a profit), so it comes as no surprise that some filmmaker would come along and try to exploit the genre for laughs (and money) - and so was born Student Bodies.  I know what you're thinking when you see the title - naked girls - but I'm going to have to disappoint you on that score.  Even though the film received an R rating, there's almost nothing R-rated about it - no actual nudity, very little profanity, and only the slightest amount of blood.  Sure, kids keep getting killed for having sex, but none of them actually live long enough to do it.  And the killer uses whatever he can find, so forget about machetes and knives and think eggplant, erasers, and paper clips.A distinctly Halloween-esque opening scene introduces us to The Breather.  Actually, you could say The Breather introduces himself to us because, even though the camera shows us each scene from his perspective, he maintains a fairly constant monologue around all of his heavy breathing.  In this fashion, he gives us a number of the film's funniest lines, such as when he's struggling to climb stairs, stepping in chewing gum, questioning his choice of footwear, or calling in to announce when and where he is going to kill next (using  a rubber chicken to disguise his voice).  We don't know who the killer really is until the end, of course, but there's no shortage of suspects at the local high school.  Don't expect any yellow tape to appear around crime scenes, by the way, because the school conducts its own investigation.  Principal Peters (Joe Talarowski) isn't going to let the murder of several students ruin the biggest school day of the year (due to budget cuts, the school has to have all extracurricular activities such as the big game, the big parade, the prom, etc. on the same day, and today's the day) - not even when a second couple are murdered at the big funeral of the first dead couple.  Instead of cops, Principal Peters calls on a few teachers and a schizophrenic psychologist to name the killer.  Meanwhile, do-gooder Toby (Kristen Riter), who has the bad habit of discovering most of the victims, conducts a secret investigation of her own.  Who could the murderer be?  Principal Peters?  The horse head bookends-obsessed (and constantly scene-stealing) shop teacher Mr. Dumpkin (Joe Flood)?  The seriously addled contortionist of a janitor?  The girl who would do anything to make sure she gets elected prom queen?  Weirdoes abound on this campus, so just about anyone could be The Breather.I should point out the fact that you don't have to be a horror fan to enjoy Student Bodies - you might not recognize the references to films such as Halloween, When a Stranger Calls, or Carrie, but that won't stop you from appreciating all of the comedy on display here.  Don't let the fact that producer Michael Ritchie went the Allen Smithee route in the credits worry you, either.  This movie is almost bursting at the seams with great one-liners.  Not only is Student Bodies a genuinely funny movie, it actually manages to stay consistently funny from start to finish - and all without resorting to the exceedingly raunchy level of similar films today.  It is possible that a few viewers might be offended by a few things here and there (such as the manner in which a blind student and a crippled student are portrayed), but I'd be lying if I said these weren't some of the movie's funniest moments.  If you have a sense of humor and don't adopt an elitist attitude toward dumb jokes, I'm willing to bet you'll find much more satisfaction in Student Bodies than all of the films in the Scary Movie franchise combined.  In this case, the first truly is the best. \n",

      " review: Optical mice are great, for the reasons everyone else is saying here.  There are two annoyances with this product, however.  If your hands aren't tiny, the mouse will be too narrow.  This is a problem because it is much more tiring and possibly painful to grip a narrow mouse over an extended period of time than it is to grip a wider one like the Microsoft mice.  The second annoyance is fairly trivial--the mouse emits a noisy 'clink' that sounds a little cheap when you press the buttons.I got this mouse for a computer I'm building for my girlfriend; I have both a Cirque touchpad, which is my absolute favorite pointing device, and a Microsoft Intellimouse with OptiEye, a discontinued optical mouse that is very nearly the same as their other optical mice.  It is very comfortable, and works great.If you ever experience any sorts of pain associated with mouse use, I highly recommend using a touchpad instead.  The benefits are that you don't have to grasp ANYTHING, you can move the cursor with a very slight touch, and you don't even have to beat the tips of your fingers up from constant clicking, since the lightest of taps on the touchpad surface achieve the same result.  In addition, you can set a touchpad on or against your leg at the same angle that your hands naturally rest in at the side of your body, rather than twisting them to the horizontal surface of a desk.  The bottom line is that the tingle I was feeling in my hand, wrist and lower arm from constant mouse use went completely away once I started using a touchpad.  Like an optical mouse, there is never any cleaning or moving parts, either, which makes them much more reliable than other mice or trackballs. \n",

      " review: Edit, 3/19/14: bought two more of these.  Have had many storms and outages since this review.  Happy camper.I'm a Panamax fan, but the recent Panamax models have opted to make a screwball side-plug design which WASTES SPACE.. so I reluctantly had to pick another brand.  The only two others I trust are Belkin and Tripp-Lite, since I already have both, and they've saved my equipment many times.  (I seem to experience a storm or other outage at least once a month for over 20 years, no matter where I've lived.)But the Belkin, doesn't specialize in filtering out line noise;  Tripp-Lite, does.  So, this Isobar, which I just bought here at Amazon, is just like my other one, except larger and more powerful.  It WILL accommodate a large adapter -- maybe not all versions.  I have an old ZIP parallel power supply, which is the largest adapter I own.  It will fit without obscuring the plugs beside it, though barely.  Most other adapters are smaller than the Zip, so should fit.  Pick the outermost plugs on the ISOBAR (or any other surge suppressor), see if that works.  If it doesn't, get a top-priced Belkin model that has good reviews.  BE SURE to check the reviews, as not all Belkin models are good.  (I bought one recently that I returned to Amazon because it had serious issues with the power on/off switch that reviewers reported.)NEVER scrimp on cost with a surge suppressor.  ALWAYS get the best model you can afford.  Having said that, you don't need to buy more protection than you need.  But never settle for a power strip alone, and never settle for a lower-priced knock-off.The Isobar shines in two ways:  a) eliminating line noise, and b) sensibly deciphering a real threat from mere variance.  Look at the other reviews here about treadmills.  Ironically, that's why I bought this Isobar, due to those reviews, though I don't use a treadmill.  Even more ironically, the very day I read those reviews, I went shopping and someone standing in the cashier's line, asked about surge protectors for a treadmill in the store.  So I was on-hand to answer!A final note: the unit was easier to plug in, than others: it has a flat plug so doesn't stick out from the wall like other surge protectors.  Additionally, it was wrapped with extra-long twist ties, so I only had to unfold one 'layer' of the cord and then retie, to get it to compactly sit with all that extra cording, in the back of my computer.  Where, it is plugged in along with my A/V equipment.  And, immediately I noticed an improvement in my cable and DVD picture, after plugging them all into this one unit.So now I'm an ISOBAR fan.  Well, there is one negative:  the actual WARRANTY doesn't offer a dollar limit, so contradicts the Amazon description, here.  Moreover, for the warranty to apply, ALL your equipment, including your phone lines, have to be protected by Tripp-Lite.  Further -- and this is very ambiguous -- the warranty says \"Reimbursement dollar limits will be equal to that of the Tripp Lite power protection protector.\"  Since NO dollar limits are specified anywhere in the 'Ultimate Lifetime Insurance Policy' section, how does one interpret that?I don't take these warranties seriously;  they mainly serve to show that the manufacturer doesn't want to have to pay up, so makes the protectors as best it can, to avoid claims. \n",

I didn't need to see this dragged-out, talky extra footage reiterating how jealous Salieri is, how childish Mozart is, and the \"new\" portrayal of Constanze is totally non-credible and offensive.

      " review: This CD is one of my most favorite titles in my entire 10,000 CD library.  I have over 40 official Zappa albums and have been listening to and collecting Zappa records ever since I was 14 in 1967 so I believe I'm qualified to judge this album.  For those who don't know, the first part of this CD is the only existing release of the original mix of the original vinyl album, \"The Man From Utopia.\"  That album was released (by itself) in a drastically altered version by Ryko circa 1992, a horribly modified and out-of-proper-sequence mix that was perpetuated by the Zappa Family Trust in their 2012 release.  This review is NOT about those CDs which do not deserve a moment more of my (or your) time.  Also, the second album on this CD is not being reviewed here either because it's the same as the independently released version, so just refer to reviews of that album and apply those comments to the second part of this album (Ship Arriving...).  This review is solely for this title which is a 2fer (2 albums on 1 CD) which was released only in France and England.  Now that we've got the small print out of the way, my first comment is about the quality of the sound recording.  Frank was always ahead of his time especially in the studio and though I wasn't there, I'm sure these tracks were recorded on an early digital recorder, perhaps the very first DAT.  That's how clean, crisp, and clear the album sounds.  Simply said, the audio quality is the highest I've ever heard.  Now, about the music on this album:  First thing to know is that this album is a mix of studio tracks and live recordings but the live tracks don't suffer the audio distractions and noises heard on typical live recordings.  They're so clean, the sounds from the audience seem like they were written into the songs and orchestrated by Frank himself.  Those half-spoken, half-sung tracks (\"The Dangerous Kitchen,\" \"The Radio Is Broken,\" and \"The Jazz Discharge Party Hats\") are accompanied by Frank's guitar playing and band improv, and are unique to this album, so they're a lot of fun to hear since you've never heard anything like this from Frank before.  Those tracks were the basis of much of the negative comments others have made about this album but I say the reverse is true, that they enhance the album, not detract from it.  The clear stand-out vocal track is the album's opener, \"Cocaine Decisions\" (again, presented in its original form as it appeared on the vinyl album), but \"Sex\" and \"Stick Together\" are a pair of songs that'll make you glad you bought those 15\" woofers.  My most favorite song is the instrumental \"We Are Not Alone,\" an epic onslaught powerhouse of music easily capable of raising the hairs on the back of your neck when cranked up loud.  You'll never hear another song that combines a tenor sax with a xylophone to accomplish that!  The song is one of the greatest album enders of all time.  Although I have read this (pre-1992) CD issue is slightly remixed, I haven't been able to hear it and I do have both this CD and the vinyl lp.  Suffice it to say that if it's true, it's inconsequential.  The important thing to know is to avoid every CD release of \"The Man From Utopia\" except THIS one, on this 2fer.  This CD is an essential acquisition as it's the sole CD issue of the original 1983 vinyl record.  All post-1992 issues are extensively remixed in an altered sequence, but do feature a bonus track (\"Luigi & The Wise Guys\") which makes THAT album necessary for completists.  Happy plooking! \n",

      " review: Yeah, I know.  You see that shiny packaging and that EXODUS symbol and excitement shoots through you as remember how cool it felt when you first listened to Bonded By Blood.  You start to think, wow, would if Tempo of the Dead sounds as cool!.....I should by it, I bet it will be at the very least pretty good!Trust me, DONT WASTE $20 ON THIS CD!! Don't let your love of Bonded By Blood decieve you into believing this is anything similar.  Bonded was the result of a band 20 years younger than the current lineup.  Not to mention a different bass player, Rob Mckillop, and a different singer, Paul Baloff.  I don't know of anyone who likes Souza over Baloff, he just isn't as talented.  Although Steve's vocals are, in my opinion better on this album than previous albums, he still just doesn't sound right.This is not the speedy 80's thrash your expecting. It's mostly slow, low sounding riffs that, while quite technical and complicated, just don't gel into a cool sounding song.  The whole album just sounds dry.  It doesn't jam.  You won't find yourself singing along to any of the songs no matter how many times you force yourself to listen to them.  The difference in this new sound of Exodus and their old sound is very similar to the difference between Overkill in the 80's/early 90's and Overkill now.  The effort is there.  You can tell they're trying.  But they've just lost the magic!  They've lost the ability to create a cool sounding song.  This is the sad truth.Top all that off with lame, un-artistic lyrics mostly concieved by Gary Holt such as the anti-american ranting of the first song Scar Spangled banner and you just have an album that isn't enjoyable.  There is one song that was written by Paul Baloff but I'm sure if he knew it was going to sound as lame as it sounds on this album he wouldn't have let them use the lyrics.R.I.P. Paul Baloff, you were awesome man...Exodus has exhausted their music making talents. They ought to hang it up for good so noone else will be ripped off buying another lame new release from them.And to all you reviewers giving 5 star ratings. GET REAL!!  Why the Heck are you lying like that?!  This is not a matter of opinion here, these guys are lying.  Their probably being paid buy the record company.DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE!!!!I'll give the album 2 stars, only for the effort put forth by the band.  But the album sucks. \n",

      " review: ****Update***I contacted Amazon, explained my issue and they replaced the phone without a problem.  They sent me a new right away! I received within 2 days of calling. Even before they received the broken phone!  It was very easy. And so far this one seems to work. Thank you Amazon!Points 1, 2 and 3 of my original reveiw still apply.  But I am happy to have it replaced and not have all of my hard earned money gone to waste. The phone is usable. It is just not the quality of what I had previously.  Too bad.  I loved my first Crosley phone.This will be okay for emergency power outages.It is just not good enough for everyday use.But....IT LOOKS GREAT!Original review:I am EXTREMELY disappointed.I had a Crosley 302 Wall Phone that I bought years ago.  My children who were not quite tall enough to reach the receiver; repeated dropped the phone receiver (even in a dog dish full of water) and it still worked.  We had to super glue, screw and tape it back together.  Until a recent (November 2012) power outage we discovered it no longer worked. I was bummed.  I loved that phone.  So, on Christmas I ordered myself a NEW Crosley 302 wall phone. Merry Christmas to me!But it is just NOT the same.Here's is why:1) The CORD is really short.  We could reach any room downstairs with the old cord, VERY LONG, had to be at least 6 ft relaxed. It hung to the floor.  This cord is only 2 ft long.  I can't do anything but stand next to the phone.2) This one is much lighter, doesn't feel substantial.  The receiver is lighter (feels cheap).  The 1st phone really felt like an \"OLD\" phone, this is definitely a reproduction and a cheap one.3) It sounds like the person you are talking to on the other end is in a tunnel.  And it intermittently becomes faint then loud.4) The last straw....Today, I tried to Dial out.  I rarely use this phone for calling out, I usually use the cordless, but the battery was dead. You know what?! I can't dial out.  The Number pad doesn't work.On my 1st try it recognized the first TWO numbers, but then nothing else.On my 2nd attempt it recognized ZERO numbers.On the 3rd attempt only ONE number.So I thought maybe it is Phone jack....maybe....I tried 2 other jacks in the house.  Still doesn't work.So needless to say I HATE this phone.  It is a cheaper version on my original phone and it doesn't work.Problem is...can I return it?  Is it too late?  It is a defect or are they all junk? \n",

      " review: This budget-priced collection from on the suddenly prolific Pazzazz label samples 14 musicians known mostly for their urban blues. As African Americans and others moved north in the pre WW-II years and later, they transformed the rural sound brought up from the Deep South and Texas.  The tensions of the industrial north, according to the traditional history of this period, contributed to the themes and sounds of the Chicago style (the city where it predominated). Of course, the electric guitar, the demands of audiences and larger venues for louder music, and progenitors like Muddy Waters and Howlin Wolf may also have had something to do with the raw and raucous sound.  Early rockers, especially the British (e.g., the Yardbirds and the Stones) took much of their material and style from  this  scene.  The CD begins with two Muddy Waters tracks from 1950 and 1951 that show some differences from his \"comeback\" performances several decades later; his voice is suppler and slightly higher.  However, the trademark stinging guitar on the opening track \"Rollin' Stone\" is unmistakable, as are the repetitive phrases (e.g., oh wells), the repeating rhythm (recalling John Lee Hooker), the high bent notes and slurs, the combination of vibrato and buzzing sounds, and the deep authoritative voice.  If anyone epitomizes the Chicago sound, it would probably be this man.  (The title of this review is from one of his songs, available on the \"Fathers and Sons\" CD.) I saw him in concert in the late 1970's; he retained all his power and his majesty; one felt as if the entire history of the blues climbed on stage with him.Little Walter may be somewhat overlooked in the pantheon of harp players, but  \"Juke\" completely rocks, and he gets a powerful and pure sound. \"Sad Hours\" is almost the opposite, a quiet, slow ballad with background harp, that accompanies a boring melody. Still, Walter get a deep-amped throaty sound that roars although it's not nearly as compelling if not as compelling as the earlier song. The great Howlin Wolf has one of the most distinctive instantly recognizable voices in music.  His voice (think Wolfman Jack, the DJ who copied Wolf's gravelly pinched sound) has great dynamics and emotion. He's somewhat of an acquired taste, but he and Muddy are the two greats of the early Chicago scene. The songs are somewhat more melodic than Muddy's with less reliance on the guitar, and more on the rhythm and attaining a raw voice through the vocals and instrumentals.  \"Moanin' at Midnight\" is justifiably one of his most famous numbers. He is truly the \"Wolf/Man\" here, almost scary in his extended moans, and his transition of his voice to an intensely concentrated sound.  The guitars are equally intense and buzzy, and the entire theme is shaded with fright and mystery.  Screaming Jay Hawkins may have been listening. It's a tour de force, turn it up loud and scare the neighbors!There's an abrupt transition (after Wolf's intensity) to Memphis Minnie.  Her apparently untrained vocal sound, deep and slightly un-pretty, is the highpoint of an otherwise banal chug-chug-chug rhythm section.  At the break, there's a nice solo interplay between the harp and guitar, although too brief, it's contains the most instrumental energy in the song.  Robert Nighthawk does \"Sweet Black Angel,\" (1949) a song covered by many groups under the title \"Sweet Little Angel.\" Nighthawk has a slow delivery, and the purposeful notes of the slide guitar are excellent.  There's a Muddy-like slide in the solo and Nighthawk turns in an exciting ballad (a sometimes problematic form for the typically loud, fast Chicago style).Jimmy Rogers has two numbers on the compilation; he's more of a crooner (if there's such a thing in Chicago blues), with soul shadings reminiscent of Sam Cooke.  He's got one of the prettiest voices here, high and smooth, and he sings with such feeling that he effectively draws your attention to the lyrics.  Rogers is the stand out here, and his voice is a revelation of the variety of blues vocal styles.  On \"Five Long Years,\" his voice is more plaintive, the harmonica (Little Walter?) is loud and potent, and the sound is less melodic and more intense. There's excellent harp and guitar, and a good balance of the instruments.  Rogers again shows his originality in his high-noted second syllables.  Eddie Boyd begins \"Five Long Years\"  (1952) in a big band style (think Count Basie and Jimmy Rushing) and he sings a more jazz-inflected sound, betrayed occasionally by his Southern accent.  The relative predominance of horns also marks this as somewhat atypical.  Unfortunately, it's not as well recorded as some of the other songs here. His second number registers more clearly, and the accompanying  sax and drums are clearly jazz oriented. Boyd's songs lack some excitement, but are historically interesting because of the crossover.Disc 2 begins with the country-infused sounds of Jimmy Reed, complete with some honky background piano, and  high notes on the harp. It's a rambling sound, with palpable roots in  rural blues.  On the second cut (\"Bright Lights, Big City,\" 1961) his voice sounds more nasal, and there's a backing female voice and chorus-the song seems designed for airplay.  Fans of the Yardbirds will instantly recognize Billy Boy Arnold's  own \"I Wish You Would\" (1955), the prominent low drums, pace, and harp riff are the same as the British group's remake in the 1960's.  Arnold has a  nice throwaway vocal style that doesn't overpower you. At the break, the harp slows and softens , then  returns for some wails accompanied  by that great incessant drumming.  This is one of the best cuts on the album. \"Then I was Fooled\" is also interesting:  There's a somewhat tiresome story about a guy and his \"chicks,\"  but the vocal is intimate and teasing.  There's an interesting bass line and some organ.  At the break, there's a great harp solo, augmented by crashing drums and ringing guitar. I don't know if anybody's remade this, but the song is ripe for re-doing.After `Fooled,' Lillian Ott almost responds to Arnold's song with \"Will My Man Be Home Tonight\" (1960). The instrumental are good if not very original, and there's some gimmicky \"crying\"  (\"don't cry, mama...go to bed\").  Memphis Slim sings \"we gonna rock...we gonna roll\" on \"Rockin' The House,\" a number that sounds like early rock rather than the Chicago blues, complete with yackety sax. The much slower \"Wish Me Well\" (also from 1959) and Memphis Red's 1953 \"Please Mr. Doctor\" has a similar  feeling, although the guitar sounds much more authentic.  J. B. Hutto keep a rural edge to the songs, adding vintage instrumentation (\"Combination Boogie\" from 1954  features a washboard, maybe a triangle), rough, more authentic sounding sounds, and  a more intense vocal style that recalls Howlin' Wolf.  It's a refreshing change from the swerve towards rock in the previous songs. Hutto shows his versatility by changing to a Muddy Waters-like vocal and instrumentation on \"Things Are So Slow.\"  The CD closes with two famous songs performed by Elmore James: The 1957 \"It Hurts Me Too\" (later done by the Stones), and James' own 1953 \"Dust My Broom.\"  James voice sounds modern (or maybe it's just the good recording), like Rogers, he commands your attention.  The backing guitar and slide solos on \"It Hurts Me Too\" are good but not all that powerful; overall, the renowned \"Dust My Broom\" has more energy.This is an excellent sampling of some of the most famous musicians on the Chicago scene, along with some not as well known today.  There's a very good variety of styles, belying the ridiculous clich&eacute; that Chicago blues sound too much alike. While the recording quality varies from good to fair, no remastering was done, and the dates range from  1941  to 1961 (with most in the `50's).  I recommend this as a budget sampler of varied musicians for those familiar with the Chicago blues, and as an introduction for novices. Hopefully, the latter will pick up some of the better-recorded albums featuring only a favorite musician or two, either from this same period, or from the blues renaissance of the 70's and 80's.  I'm dinging this a bit partly for sound quality, and mostly because the liner notes are pitifully lacking. There's a very, very brief discussion of the blues, and the track information contains the year of the recording, the writer, and the publisher only; personnel are not listed. \n",

      " review: The search for Orson Welles' late masterpiece \"Chimes at Midnight\" just got a little easier.  A Brazilian DVD import takes the Welles classic into the digital age and offers an alternative to the out-of-print Arthur Cantor VHS release.\"Chimes at Midnight\" is one of the great Shakespearean adaptations and a true 'lost classic'. It's also the last masterpiece that Orson Welles directed in his lifetime, and with 'Citizen Kane,' 'Magnificent Ambersons' and 'Touch of Evil' comprises a quartet of major cinematic works by Welles. Though rarely seen, \"Chimes at Midnight\" has influenced modern filmmakers. Mel Gibson, for example, admitted the famous \"Battle of Shrewesbury\" scene influenced his own \"Braveheart.\"The film is an inventive re-editing and condensation of Shakespeare's plays, spanning from the end of Richard II to the beginning of Henry V. The film shifts the focus from the titular English kings to the character of Jack Falstaff, played by Welles himself in a virtuoso performance. Falstaff's relationship with young Prince Hal (later Henry V) is explored, and uncannily parallels Welles' own experience with the young talents of Hollywood.There are several great performances, by John Gielgud as Henry IV, Keith Baxter as Hal, Kenneth Branagh look-alike Norman Rodway as Hotspur, Welles regular Jeanne Moreau as Doll Tearsheet, and the great Dame Margaret Rutherford (of \"Miss Marple\" fame) as Mistress Quickly.\"Chimes at Midnight\" can be a jarring experience due to inconsistent film quality, low budget sets and Welles' flair for shock cuts. Once you adapt to the style and limitations, it's a truly rewarding experience. Welles has found a deeply moving story between the lines of Shakespeare's histories.\"Chimes at Midnight\" was Welles' final attempt to popularize Shakespeare for the masses. With any luck, this film will eventually reach the wider audiences that Welles failed to achieve in his lifetime. \n",

      " review: I have been playing ToonTown Online for close to 2 years now. A co-worker got me hooked on it after her child got her hooked on it after seeing a commerical for it on The Disney Channel. Yes, it is an online game (hence the name ToonTown Online) and it very specifically indicates on the packaging that a recurring fee is necessary to play it after the initial 2 month game time has expired.  The game is downloadable from the ToonTown website and the retail version is NOT a necessity to have. The game is a HUGE download and the CD is great to have if you have dial-up internet access like I do.As for play value, it is great.  I have 2 active toons (you can have 6) on my account that I play on a regular basis.  Yes, it is geared towards kids but many of the players I encounter are adults that were hooked by their children.  It is safe for kids as there are pre-made phrases that you use for your toon to communicate with other toons.  There is the option for real-life players to \"code\" with each other so they can speak freely with each other.  Even with the free speech being available, it is heavily filtered for bad language.  I have tested many different \"bad\" words in various spellings and even inserted spaces and other characters to attempt to get it to let it come across but it won't.  Kudos to Disney for being proactive in anticipating what lengths some people will go to spoil kid fun.The concept of the game is not different than any other MMOG like EverQuest, Final Fantasy etc.  You are given quests to complete for jellybeans (money), gags (weapons) and laff boosts (strength). The only difference is that this game is designed for children.It is well worth the $10 a month and the game is always expanding. Since I have been playing there have been 2 major updates and a 3rd is scheduled for sometime in April or May, giving toons an additional neighborhood/Cog HQ to play in with new tasks and rewards.Happy Tooning. \n",

      " review: I bought this product for my 1st gen iPod Nano, specifically to wear on my arm while I run.  It has been exposed to sweat, heat, cold, rain, etc., and my iPod has been perfectly protected.My FAVORITE FEATURE is the clip.  Without removing it from the protective sleeve, I can attach or remove from the armband, depending on what I'm using it for. When worn on the arm, there is no irritation from the clip itself.  If I'm running with a jacket or using it for something other than exercise, I can clip it to my waistband, jacket, etc.  It clips very securely.  I love the fact that I never have to remove it from its sleeve, no matter where I'm taking it.  The velcro flap at the bottom opens to easily access the port for charging.I have not had any problems using the wheel while in the case.  It is a *little* less sensitive than without, but I am overall satisfied with its performance.Great buy on Amazon... I paid $29.99 at a \"retail discounter.\" \n",

My review here is more of a Public Service Announcement for idiots like me who have never changed their own strings.MAKE SURE YOU KNOW what kind of FINE TUNER you have on your violin.  Maybe I'm the only 50+ year old violinist who didn't realize that there are some tuners that require ball ends and others than require loop ends.  When I put a ball-end string on my loop-end tuner, I couldn't understand why I was suddenly getting a buzz.  Finally found something online that showed me the difference.  Doh!  I feel stupid.Just glad I learned this with my violin (where the cost of the mistake was only 8 bucks to replace the string) as opposed to my cello where the A string costs nearly 4 times that amount!As I said, perhaps I'm the last person to know this out here in &#34;change your own string&#34; land but in case there is someone else out there, this review is for you![NCJAR] \n",

      " review: My son (15 months) loves the toy.  The wooden knobs are big enough for him to grasp easily.  The puzzle itself is made of a lightweight particle board material.  The pictures are stickered onto the wood.  There is alot of dust.  The pieces are not all cut very well, you will have to sand down the sides of at least the circle piece.You'll have to clean it when you get it because it is full of dust.  Do not let your baby put it in their mouth because it will take the sticker off.  The puzzle is not painted.The circle piece is not well cut.  It needs to be sanded down.  My son has trouble putting it in because it doesn't fit in every orientation as it should, so I am unhappy about that which is why it is not five stars.  Overall its cute and my son enjoys playing with it.  I am unhappy about the quality, but I would buy it again as long as its not 15 dollars. 15 is too much for this low quality. \n",

      " review: There are some seriously whack characters in this anime--notably, some of the villains. Which is fine by me.Mostly, I enjoyed the combination of goofy-but-very-seriously-revengeful hero-in-black-hat with his ever-increasing coterie of fighters and crushgirls. The mecha elements are quite cool, as is the humor surrounding the laconic hero and his culinary peculiarities and less-than-astute awareness of what's going on about him. He pretty much is good in a fight, and exasperating to many otherwise. A loner who simply won't be left alone, which is amusing in itself.The finale didn't suck, although I will totally admit that I wanted just a wee bit more denoument and follow-up. After all the heartaches and heroics and antics, I really wanted to see loose ends tied up more neatly.But the ending is as silly-cute as much of the non-vengeful action stuff, so it is suitable.All in all, a visually fun, often quite nicely written, cute and action-packed mecha-mania anime where the English voice actors did a great job.Really, really liked it.Mir \n",

      " review: People use garlic to prevent plaque buildup on the arteries, improve high blood pressure, reduce coughs, colds, bronchitis, and even pneumonia.The antibiotic activity of one milligram of allicin (the active ingredient in garlic), equals 15 units of penicillin. It is an extremely effective, broad-spectrum antibiotic, killing gram negative and gram positive. Garlic's use has been proven to destroy many types of bacteria.In studies, garlic has also been shown to be effective against parasites. Some studies show promise in using garlic to treat children's ear infections.Studies are mixed, but several have found garlic to slightly  lower blood pressure.Garlic remedies have also been used to treat cancer, the common cold, diabetes, high cholesterol, atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries), and more.Garlic is best eaten raw (although most folks will not take the raw form due tot he smell) and the most potent garlic preparations are the ones made at home. Although raw garlic is the most potent, most folks who take garlic take it in supplemental form. The average dose for supplementation is 500 - 1,000 mg/day. Dosages for children under the age of 16 have not been determined.Garlic is considered to have very low toxicity and is listed as Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the United States.Side effects from garlic include upset stomach, bloating, bad breath, body odor, and a stinging sensation on the skin from handling too much fresh or dried garlic. Handling garlic may also cause the appearance of skin lesions. Other side effects that have been reported by those taking garlic supplements include headache, fatigue, loss of appetite, muscle aches, dizziness described as vertigo (namely, the room spinning), and allergies such as an asthmatic reaction or contact dermatitis (skin rash).Garlic has blood-thinning properties so people with bleeding disorders, such as hemophilia or platelet disorders, should not use garlic supplements or medicinal doses of garlic. This is also important to know if you are going to have surgery or deliver a baby. Too much garlic can increase your risk for bleeding during or after those procedures.Garlic is best taken each day with a meal.Jim \"Konedog\" Koenig \n",

      " review: I purchased this Alaskan Deluxe Fir w/Clear minis (1350) on Dec. 16, and it will be here on Dec. 18 via standard shipping (this item qualified for Accelerated Shipping through Amazon).I bought my first Barcana Christmas Tree in 1989 - 20 years ago.  It has been a quality, fantastic tree for all those years, especially since I have moved all over the U.S. and Mexico during those years.  I was putting it up for the 20th year, and while it still looks good, could be fluffed and decorated to be great, I thought, why not get a new one after all these years - I know a few of the fronds have come off and lots of needles have fallen off due to moves, wear, tear, etc.  I paid about 575.00 for it back then at a Christmas Store (full retail during season) - today full retail is 1200.00.  If I were to average the cost over 20 yrs, it would be about 28.00 yr, and I haven't had to kill any more trees that take 6 to 10 years to mature for a use that lasts only 2-3 weeks.I have seen many artificial trees, most of which look horrible.  I bought the Barcana because it is so realistic and durable.  I am buying it again because my 1st Tree has served so well for so long, and because we will not be moving again for some time and will not have to put the tree through too much moving, wear and tear.This time, I bought a tree with the lights already installed, a huge convenience - each year I have to re-string the old tree.  With this purchase from Amazon, I know I am paying wholesale or close to it because I called the Barcana Showroom in Atlanta.  The other prices on the internet are more than 200.00 higher.Thank you Amazon for a superb quality product, a price that is only 75.00 more than I paid over 20 yrs ago, and for offering a 'selected item' status to this product so it would ship in record time using Standard Shipping.  This is one of the best values I have found in some time, and highly recommend the Barcana brand, and Amazon. \n",

The reason I bridged the modem to my router is because my network was already set up and I didn't want to have to set it up all over again, or I would've just used the DHCP server part of it, too.The only thing keeping this product from receiving five stars from me is the interface can be confusing because of the myriad choices you can make.  My advice is the same as what the manual recommends: use automatic settings where possible.  It shouldn't defeat the determined noob, and it should cause waves of pleasure to wash over the experienced uber-geek.Overall, it is a solid choice for a complete DSL/Network solution! \n",

It could be heard especially when the music had dead air. So natuarally I returned it to Brookstone and got an exchange for it. This one new only lasted a few days. First off, the battery life after a full charge only lasted for about a couple of hrs. I thought maybe I didn't charge it enough (hoping for the best) so I plugged it in for a recharge and at the same time, I used my iPod while it did. Then about a half hour later, the whole thing stopped working all together. Battery or being plugged in were no longer an issue. It's a piece of junk.

Beware because if you return it due to the mislabeled size,  Amazon will still charge you for the return.  My daughter, a tween, wanted a more modest suit than the ones available for 12-year olds.

      " review: The series is interesting in that it shows a life that most viewers have little idea about.  The interviews with involved members, both inside and outside of prison paints a grim picture of the lifestyle that is tough to live but easy to glamorize.When I watched the first season DVDs over a weekend I really began to notice the repeated use of some stock footage and audio.  I realize that in a \"documentary\" style often they have to stretch still photos into moving images and use sound effects to liven things up but I think some are overused.  I don't remember it being bothersome when episodes are watched individually over a longer period of time however so depending on your viewing habits you might not be bothered.Many of the gangs are simply copy-cats of each other and therefore some of the episodes became rather blahh as a result.  I would have rather had an episode or two on generic gang topics like how they acquire weapons and drugs to perhaps tags and symbology interpreted for a change of pace.  As it is this series is sort of like a Who's-Who index of gangs rather than a look at the broader picture and what traits many of these groups share and why. \n",

A lot of people who write with their right hand don't understand that it's tough for a lefty to get the right pen. Righty's obviously have a completely different writing style than us lefty's! Getting to the point, this is the only pen I ever use now. This is one of the easiest pens for me to use, and the way it writes is extremely smooth. I don't have to worry about getting the ink of my pinky finger that every left dreads because we drag our hand across the writing surface-the ink dries fast enough so that doesn't happen. I am sure that this pen is great for everybody, both lefty's and righty's because ever since I started using them, a whole bunch of people at my school now have them! By far, this is the best pen ever. I highly recommend it to you, and to all lefty's for that matter! Only downside is that it runs out of ink pretty quickly if your a lefty, don't ask me why, I don't know, but I don't care because of how awesome the pen is.

I have the feeder hung from a tree outside my office window, so can easily watch it whenever I'm in office. On occasions when I've let the battery die, the squirrels eventually figure that out and attack the feeder - usually by hanging on the top and chewing the edges of it (until they get an opening all the way back to the seed when i left it to see what they would do). My solution is to change the battery every 3 months.I did have a bear reach up and pull the feeder down to get the seed, so i hung it from a pipe between two trees that kept the bottom of the feeder more than 8' high. Bear problem solved. This feeder will keep the squirrels away as long as it has a good battery and there are no bears around. \n",

I will post his evaluation after he has used the device for a while.  From my perspective I love the lighted keyboard.  While I am a touch typist I still need to see the keys occasionally especially to input complex passwords in low light conditions.  The keyboard has a nice touch/feel and seems to be fairly well built for my purposes.  The detachable keypad is a nice feature; however it would have been a better feature if they had, in addition to the magnet installed a slot that you could attach the pad to the keyboard so that when you pick up the keyboard it doesn't fall off.  Numerous nice features, i.e., adjustable light intensity is a nice touch but I can't help wondering what happens when the lights go out?  Is there something that can be easily replaced?  or are you just light less?  From my perspective this keyboard is what it is advertised \"a gaming keyboard\".  It is now in my son's hands and I will post his review once he has had time to use it for a while. \n",

      " review: These things are ugly in your pots---but you aren't there, so I guess it's Ok. The main thing is they do keep some moisture in the pots which the plant can draw from, when the soil gets dry. Now, two things:1.) They are designed for small pots. So if you have big potted plants, you need multiple packs  and they likely aren't going to work quite as well because the moisture is on the surface, instead of at the roots.*2.) If you have multiple stems filling your pot---like some philodendron, spider plants, ferns, etc.--it's hard to make contact with the soil.*The company does make a sleeve that you could build into your potted plant when you plant it and then you could slip the tubes of gel down toward the roots, which would probably work great on larger plants. But you couldn't really do that with established plants.But--bottom line, the plants were only a tiny bit wilted and I did not have to ask someone to come by and water them twice. I'd probably buy them again. \n",

If you're a Nomi fan deciding whether to take the risk (as I did), then read on. . .This album is under 32 minutes in length. It contains the theme tune from the 60s TV series Dangerman, called 'Highwire'. It contains one reasonable 'live' (ish') performance from Klaus Nomi of the title track. It contains a very poor quality version of Rubberband Laser, that sounds like an old tape demo. It contains a slightly better quality version of 'Silent Night' with what sounds like a backing track added afterwards.The rest of the CD contains riffs, and jangly jams mixed in with Klaus Nomi's voice. Some of Nomi's voice has been sampled and played like an instrument so often feels odd and lacks continuity. Much of the original Nomi theme appears over and over again throughout the 'Opera'.Music is credited to George Elliot and Page Wood (except 'Highwire', 'Rubberband Laser' and 'Silent Night'. Klaus Nomi is not credited with any writing.Overall, it sounds very amateurish and there is not sufficient original material to justify the billing of Klaus Nomi. It's clear that it was just an embryo of an idea that Nomi may (or may not) have had for a third album.  Anyone thinking about this should only do so out of a sense of completion, just because it offers a few snippets of Klaus Nomi.And so to the artwork and design which are excellent. The CD offers a cryptic little booklet with little stories involving Klaus Nomi, but well produced as it is, it does have the effect of making the finished product feel far more significant than it is. It is not a Klaus Nomi album! It's a few crumbs served up on a nice plate.It really is a case of style over content and a reminder of a much missed talent. \n",

I really like this package because I love the colors ;)These folders are the same size as my other plain letter size folders, however, the tab \"stands out\" more because the folder (to the sides of the tab) are not as high, and the cutout of the tab is lower - so the tab information is more prominent - which is GREAT!  The folder will hold the same amount as it did in other folders.  I have a picture of a regular tab and a SuperTab so you can see what I mean how the sides are not as high on the SuperTabs (I've uploaded it on the product page).

On the other-hand, the seller did an excellent job with shipping the camcorder, in which took only around two days to get to my house! And they were totally cool with me returning it as well.This \"battery\" issue was not because the camcorder was malfunctioning or anything, rather it was the battery life, and the fact that it required AA batteries. When I was reading the comments on this product, I read that this thing had a knack for drinking up the batteries really fast.I didn't think this was going to be a problem... until I tried it out for myself. I used two full batteries that were hardly used, and it ate them as if it were going out of style! I used the camcorder very sparingly throughout the day because I saw how quickly it used up the batteries that came with it, and it still was at low battery at the end of the day!For some of you, this might not be a problem. To me, it bothered me a lot. It would cost extra money, even to get rechargeable batteries, and I would still have to deal with the battery life! AA batteries just didn't fly with me, but again, that's not everyone's case. Otherwise that, the video preformed nicely, and the photos or \"stills\" worked for me. Though it did take a second from pushing the photo button to actually snap the picture. And I noticed there was a soft ringing or noise in the sound when I played back video.These are minor setbacks, the only major complaint for me was the battery. I was really happy with the service I got from the seller, and the footage I shot with the camcorder as well.-Keep in mind this is \"weather-resistant\", not \"water-proof\", \"shock-proof\", or anything like that. The camcorder does fine in light rain, but I wouldn't go for a dip or test it's \"ruggedness\". It can take a light knock if at that. \n",

      " review: in which they have revitalized yet another milestone in composer Jerry Goldsmith's career by releasing in complete form (finally!) his complete music from the 1978 thriller THE BOYS FROM BRAZIL. It also helps complete a collection of complete score releases of those projects the composer collaborated on with director Franklin J. Schaffner. They worked on seven films together and they always marked a turning point for Goldsmith who admitted that every time he worked with Schaffner marked his growth as a composer. This score is certainly no exception.Initially released on LP by A&M; Records with the film's release it made for a very cohesive listening experience asthe composer selected various cues from the score to fashion an uninterrupted suite lasting nearly twenty minutes with the second side of the record featuring a song and two extra tracks from the score. As much as I enjoyed the album it suffered from the omission of many choice musical moments which Intrada has corrected on this excellent (yet limited) release which sold out nearly a year after its release in 2008.What really stands out in this music is the composer's amazing facility to immerse himself in the differing styles of such classical masters as Strauss and Wagner. The film's main theme is an amalgamation of the lilting Viennese waltz he devised and the brutal seven note motif for tuba/trombone. Goldsmith's harmonic language here is one of his most accessible and enjoyable and was generously displayed on the original album but here his harder edged action writing for the Nazis is also given a large amount of exposition here. One of the most outstanding moments of the score is the first previously unreleased track, \"The Killers Arrive\" in which the composer allows the Nazi motif to make its first appearance and dominate by way of the immense brass section of the National Philharmonic Orchestra. It is well over five minutes and gradually builds to a lush treatment of the waltz theme (the Strauss influence with the Nazi motif obviously his take on the Teutonic heaviness of Wagner's music).For those out there who are die hard fans of this particular composer this is definitely one of his best works that should be in any collection. Like other releases of Goldsmith's music from that label THE BOYS FROM BRAZIL ispresented on two discs: the first presents the complete score (including pieces that never made it into the finished film) as heard in the film in chronological order and the second presents the original soundtrack album digitally remastered and includes several bonus features including source music and alternate versions of \"The Hospital\" and \"The Killers Arrive.\" I was lucky enough to snap up a copy when they were first released (and will never part with it) and was overjoyed to finally hear all the music after thirty years of hearing it in my head. The booklet is excellent and full of interesting information. Their most recent releases in this two-disc format are PATTON and FIRST BLOOD and I can't wait to get those. Like their other two Goldsmith releases in this format (THE WIND AND THE LION and ALIEN) those two are regular releases and not limited editions and worth having as well.But THE BOYS FROM BRAZIL is one of Goldsmith's aggressively best works of the 1970s---hell, his whole career---and if you can snap up a copy then do so, its a great score. \n",

And the top of my foot was a little too \"tall\" for the boot.As another reviewer mentioned, the leather is very stiff.  It's unlikely that you could break them in to better fit your feet.  And the top of boot did chafe a little bit against my shin, but that wasn't the biggest problem.So... cute as they are, I had to return them.  Even if you have other Danskos that fit well, I suggest that you try these on in person before you order them. \n",

I had the smaller sound hole port directed at a wall about 6 inches away and that sounded 'muddy', so I directed the sound port facing into the center of the room and I liked it much better.  I'd buy these again.Oh, one word for parents of smaller kids--these are not speakers that you want placed where curious little hands can get to them.  Unlike some other products, these offer little or no protection for the speakers.  Very light cloth over the small speakers and the large speaker has no cover at all. \n",

I have owned (destroyed)far to many Bluetooth units over many years and until now not a single one (NEVER) lived up to their marketing hype! The bottom line is comparing cost, function, and the long history of Plantronics reliability this unit is best in it's class dollar for dollar.You will not regret making this purchase - so do what I did and put your money on the table for what I think is a great deal for a quality product. I purchased my first one here at Amazon about two weeks ago. After two solid weeks of using this in the office, car, dump truck, and in a really bad downpour stuck outdoor talking on the cell and getting soaked I was so sold on it. I'm convinced it will last for year and just purchased a second on for my wife. Throw that Motorola in the trash - it can't hold a candle to this unit! I am even considering purchasing another five plus units for our office staff's phones - I truly believe the Plantronics is number one in its class for professional equipment. \n",

When I called to get the extra two months extended on my warranty, I was told they could not do that and the warranty was effective immediately upon purchase of the warranty.  I had to argue and be on hold a lot before I was finally granted my request to cancel the warranty, but only received a refund for 10 months.

The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is they really should have made some of this clear in the instructions.This paint is very water and absorbs into paper easily.  You will want to put down a backing paint (match it to the color of whatever you are painting on.  We put down white paint on a white poster board) and then apply the glow-in-the-dark paint on top of that.If you do it that way, it will do a pretty good job of glowing in the dark.  If you don't do the backing paint it will seem really faint because so much of it gets absorbed.  The paint holds the light pretty well and continues to be visible in the dark a couple of hours after exposure to light.Its pretty good if used right, but you have to do trial and error (or read some reviews) to know that. \n",

The quality of the acting and story allowed me to enjoy this cringing portrayal of a father on a mission of revenge.  I like stories that take a more realistic approach to their characters (e.g., displays heroes with flaws rather than being perfect) and this movie delivers great characters in spades.  The Horseman is a hidden gem among many other revenge films that just can't match it's dark, gritty, and powerful story, characters, and actor's performances. \n",

      " review: This figure is great! This figure for me represents the best of what this line offers. A character that runs the risk of coming off hokey and silly as much as the Spectre might, actually comes off as elegant, simple, and for lack of a better word: beautiful. If toys were (are) art, than this is a masterpiece.The standard DC male body type is used of course so it is like 90% retool. The articulation is standard and is a bit hindered by the cape but Spectre isn't known for his extreme poses anyway.The great aspects that make this figure really worth getting does lie in the incredible detail put into the new pieces which are the head, hands, feet, and cape. The Four Horsemen team did a superb job in interpreting the long, grim face of the Spirit of Vengence. Not only that but the deft execution of the signature \"conjuring\" hands, collar, and hood simply enhance the quality of the figure.The paint job though does an incrdible job of enhancing the sculpted detail Soft gray brushing on the exposed skin keeps the figure looking statuesque and less like some infants toy. The choice of using a darker green for the outfit serves up a fantastic contrast in color.Even with the 90% retooling this figure feels new and fresh because of the attention to detail. Highly recommended for any figure collector.P.S.- There is a glow in dark variant of this figure which is only good for the novelty of having a glowing spectre. It is not as good as the regular one in my opinion. \n",

I am used to wearing dillards private label bras and also custom-bras ($75 and not expensive when compared to La Perla)...and this bra was the best feeling I have worn in years. I am definitely glad I ordered it. I got my nude or toast color for only like $30 so for me, this was a steal! I love it so much today, I ordered two other Wacoal bras on amazon.com to try in my 36DDD size.The best part is that since it holds me up, not quite-too-pointed but not so round it looks like I am padded. Basically, it appears to look like a got something lifted naturally, which is absolutely amazing!  I also cannot believe how wonderful it is to wear a bra and not feel it on me...that is what I immediately tested before hand washing it, because then I'd have to return it.I am so glad to find this bra, 5 stars so far but again, will update if I have any thing else that I like or dislike.The bra itself is quite pretty and the toast color went great with my dark brown coloring. I am ectastic. Great bra for me, not so sure if others will find it the same. I always op measure before buying a brand and I went to herroom.com and went through all the details about sizing and measuring and specifically Wacoal to ensure that I was not making a huge mistake since every brand can be slightly different as to how they fit on women and Wacoal makes bras for well-endowed women so this was selling point. I bough it, it fits beautifully, and I highly recommend it. If you see no updates, this means I am wearing it merrily with no problems. \n",

It even includes the ability to get a small battery life extension using 2 AA batteries.  But using it requires taking youriPod Touchout of it too often and it's also uncomfortable to hold vertically.  Perhaps the biggest design flaw is that using it covers up the external speaker, requiring you to use the headphones.

But the design creates the risk of damaging your iPod Touch because you have to take your iPod out of it to do almost anything.  It also prevents you from using the external speaker, which is a deal breaker for many gamers.  If you use headphones all the time like I do, that might be OK.

      " review: I have both dogs and a cat. More than once, they've gotten into a knitting project and tangled themselves up in it or run off with it. This bin holds yarn and lets you pay it out through the top. You can actually have more than one project going it it. And the zip accessory bag keeps crochet hook, darning needles, tubes of beads, needle gauge, counter right at hand and neatly together. I can move around the house (from den, to office, to bedroom) with the tote and continue my knitting or bring it along to work for lunch time break or to a doctor's office.The yarn is dispensed through the top of the bag. There are two slits, with rounded eyelets on the ends, all edges covered with a smooth tape for snag-free flow of your yarn. The slits let you insert your hand without zipping open the top. There is a mesh pocket on the side, where you could keep a pattern handy. The bottom is made of a plastic that looks waterproof to keep the bag dry inside, in case you place it on a damp deck or table outside.There is a zip case that hangs from the side and this is handy for needles, especially double point needles, and all the small accessories that are hard to keep track of, like a row counter, measuring tape, stitch markers and beads in ziploc bags. This way, you don't have to rummage around the big bag for small items.The periwinkle color is cheerful. To keep it from collapsing when I am using small balls of yarn (for lace or socks) I put in a sleeve of some cardboard to keep it rigid. That's the only flaw--the empty bag tends to collapse, but it stays up with lots of contents or just insert a cardboard sleeve. If you knit on a deck or with pets around, or like to take along projects in the car or on trips, this is a very well-designed project bag. \n",

So far it seems to be doing a good job charging my variety of NimH batteries I have at home.  One thing I don't like is that the batteries that come with the charger really don't seem that great. They didn't come \"Pre-charged\" like many newer Nimh batteries do these days, and they don't seem to have the same tech as the newer Nimh batteries on the market that keep their charge longer than older traditional Nimh batteries. I think these new Nimh batteries are sometimes refered to as \"hybrid Nimh\" batteries... such as the Eneloop batteries by  Sanyo.  The newer hybrid Nimhs solve most of the problems with rechargeables, so it's disappointing that the batteries that are included are not up to par with these.  I had assumed most Nimh battery manufacturers had upgraded to this new hybrid Nimh technology... this is not the case, and it's dissapointing. The charger itself seems to work good though. The only negative thing about this charger I can think of this that it the form factor is pretty big. I mean, it's pretty much the largest modern battery charger I have seen. So, it's not that great for travel or portability. Also, you must charge batteries in Pairs... not individually. \n",

      " review: I bought this set from a local K-Mart store when it was clearanced out (with an additional 50% off all clearanced toys) and wasn't sure what to expect for sure. I had read a few reviews online, about this brand, and most were not very positive.Overall, we are very satisified with this set. THe instructions were very clear and easy to read. I built both vehicles in about an hour. The blocks went together just as they should, and stayed together (one review I read stated they would not stay together). My son played with them for a while, and they never fell apart at all.For the money, I think these are an excellent alternative to the Lego Brand building blocks. We had absolutely no complaints, and saved a LOT of money compared to a similar sized set in the Lego Brand (I paid $7.00 from K-Mart, and see now Amazon has this set for $5.99 currently). \n",

      " review: on general principle i'm all in favor of the warts-and-all approach, but there's such a thing as too many warts and not enought \"all.\"NAKED is a textbook example of that lopsidedness. this film's angle on it's subject isn't simply negative, it's downright snotty! you only have to listen to \"In My Life\" or \"Give Peace A Chance\" to know that, at least some of the time, he was more likable and compassionate than this.Christopher Eccleston does a positively magnificent job for the most part, but he's at the mercy of a hopelessly biased script. i firmly believe that Eccleston is capable of channeling the humanist Lennon, the Lennon who wrote \"Imagine,\" but he's only given the opportunity to project the darker side, the Lennon who wrote the petty anti-Paul song \"How Do You Sleep?\"(interestingly, Paul is played here by Andrew Scott, most famous, at least at this writing, for his villainous turn in SHERLOCK. one wonders how Sir Paul feels about being portrayed by Jim Moriarty!)the basic message of this movie is: John Lennon was a dick. and yes, he could be. indeed, wouldn't be the first case we've heard of artistic genius going hand-in-hand with dick tendencies. but who on Earth ever asked to see that side of him prioritized to the point of completely obscuring the talent, the imagination, the heart that endeared him to us in the first place? that's the part that piques what interest we would have in such a film. just because he wasn't a goody-two-shoes doesn't mean we have to hate his guts, does it?(to say nothing of the fact that we all have our less appealling attributes. let he who is without character faults cast the first stone!)another move that does more harm than good is frequent interspersing of archive footage of the bonafide Lennon. Eccleston may manage to make himself look Lennon-esque, but he's hardly such a clone that you'd ever confuse the two. so that technique only serves to confuse the viewer.there's only one thing that makes this production worth your time, and that is Eccleston's truly mesmerizing performance. he actually manages to make you forget, albeit fleetingly, that he was The Doctor. and since it was DOCTOR WHO that finally put Eccleston on the map, that's the acid-test right there.it's a true masterstroke of the thespianic art, and it's a cryin' shame that Eccleston wasn't given a more respectfully objective vehicle with which to demonstrate it. this film made me feel truly lousy, even guilty, about being a Beatles fan.also, hasn't John been pretty much biopic'd out by now? isn't it about time for Paul or Ringo get their turn? \n",

The second star is for a bunch of reason, the game-flow is slow and sometimes boring, I think the idea to get points and spend it to &#34;earn&#34; something is better in a RPG games than a adventurer game if the idea is tray to show a progress and grow up from the character itself, OK that progress can be imply over the story continue not stop it and think &#34;Ok I want spend this on mmm...mmm... ok more bullets... ok now, o yes Lara is trying to find that thing....mmm so...&#34;, That kind of things is good only in Rpg games, in adventurer games I want jump, fall, climb, shoot, discover the secret without pause the mood and obviously fight, what happen with the melee action?, Lara doesn't Fight actually she needs run or dodge if a bad guy are to close, I want punch or kick he not run.In another hand the music is amazing I will buy the soundtrack, the actress for Lara Croft made a superior work (you can see her in extras file), the story is not amazing but is interesting and you can enjoy it, It's a really good game but no amazing. \n",

      " review: (Cross-posted from the Frida Fantastic book blog)A lot of fantasy involves a hero on a fetch quest to save the kingdom from invading hordes. But what if the hero failed? This is exactly the beginning of this book.The central premise is amazing and makes this book stand out from its contemporaries. Epic fantasy as a subgenre seems to like its epic wars and the threat of invasion, but it doesn't concern itself much with a logical consequence of war--colonialism. Medair fetches the Horn of Farak, but she dooms her kingdom when she falls asleep in an enchanted labyrinth. She wakes up five hundred years later to find that her homeland is no longer hers. The Ibisian invaders now rule the lands, and Medair's disappearance and the collapse of her kingdom has become the stuff of legend. Her kingdom's people mostly have been wiped out, or they're of mixed blood and identify themselves as Ibisians.Medair is on the wrong side of history, and has to come to terms with her homeland as a colonized space. What more is that she still has the powerful artefact that is capable of nothing less than genocide. While she hides her true identity, different factions pull her into escalating wars. She has to decide whether to side with her invaders, and what justice really means in this new context. So yes, plenty of engaging ideas there.The narrative is introspective and filled with flashbacks, but it works so well because Medair is such a complex heroine. She is deeply loyal to her dead kingdom, feels disgust towards the Ibisians, but is also a very compassionate human being. The rest of the cast is interesting even if mysterious, and the rich dialogue is filled with carefully chosen words and courtly intrigue. Every moment changes her relationship with the Ibisians, creating an intense build up to her final decision which could alter the fate of her homeland.H&ouml;st's intricate prose and world-building is a joy to sink into. I wanted to race through the pages because I couldn't wait to see how the story unfolds, but I forced myself savour each word. I stopped to re-read scenes several times because they were so emotionally powerful and I wanted to hold on to the moment. But it's quite possible that I sympathized with Medair so much that I also felt her sense of dread.I love how this story brings a historical understanding of culture and politics to an epic fantasy setting. It's very refreshing compared to some of the epic fantasy I've read over the years where different factions are racially essentialized into a couple of simplistic traits, are forever foes, and are unchanging for millennia. But I thought this novel approaches race as more of a social construct-a fluid category. Medair notes the subtle differences in pigmentation and body type, which may be may be significant for neighbouring peoples turned colonizer and colonized, but perhaps not that significant to someone outside of those countries. Different ethnicities are described with certain attributes, but the attributes are ultimately cultural. As Medair notices, culture mixes and changes over time, and that changes how she relates to the Ibisians.It's also interesting how Medair becomes a political symbol. An extremist group calls themselves Medarists, and their goal is to overthrow Ibisian power and put any person with Ibisian blood into slavery. They're also waiting for Medair's fabled return and consequent call to arms. I liked the disconnect between the politics-using-the-person-as-a-symbol, and the actual politics of the person herself. The only other story I recall seeing this point of view is from Ursula K. Le Guin's short story \"The Day Before the Revolution\", but Medair isn't an aging revolutionary-she wants nothing to do with the movement named after her. I liked the inclusion of this group, and I thought they added more depth to the politics of this world.It took a few chapters for it to really grab me, and I wanted more from the plot because I felt like it was just the beginning of something bigger. Some of the formal titles of the nobility are hard to remember because they're similar and all start with the letter K, but these are very minor complaints. This book may be too introspective and brooding for some, but the earnest emotional core, original ideas, and beautiful prose definitely makes it re-read material for me.The Silence of Medair is an intelligent, absorbing, and poignant fantasy novel. Readers should take note of this work, especially if you're interested in an epic fantasy or a memorable heroine. It's an excellent read and it's highly recommended.Note: A free review copy was provided by the author. \n",

      " review: I don't usually write a bad review but I felt compelled to issue a warning to anyone investing time/money in this series of books.  I felt duped -- if I had known there were 12 books in this series, I probably wouldn't have continued past book 1.  This didn't have to be a 12 book series -- most of these books could have been combined into 2 or more instead of stretching it out (to the tune of $2.99 per -- 6 books would have made more sense - well 11 - books 2 and 3 were combined).I didn't rate it as a 1 star based on this criticism because the story is compelling -- I have to admit the \"cliff hanger\" at the end of books 6 and 7 inspired me to bite the bullet and purchase the next book in the series yet again.  Whether or not I will buy 9-12 remains to be seen.  (note to author:  that's my version of a cliff hanger-are you getting another $16 from me?).The typos and grammatical errors are no longer bothering me but have you ever heard of spell check?  Are you smarter than a 5th grader?So the bottom line is:  don't access the first book unless you're willing to 1) end it not knowing what eventually happens - 2) spend a lot of time finding out what eventually happens - 3) spend a lot of money to find out what eventually happens.  Fair warning! \n",

They worked great to quickly cool the coffee off to a drinkable temperature...no more waiting 20 minutes so I wouldn't scald my mouth on that first sip.  They were lousy at KEEPING the coffe at that drinkable temperature though, and that's what I really wanted.All that changed when I a Contigo vacuum insulated steel mug for about 20 bucks.(http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004LLHMU0/ref=oh_details_o02_s00_i00).With the good mug, my coffee still very quickly dropped to a drinkable temperature, but then it stayed hot for hours.  Now I pour my coffee into the mug with 5 Joulies before I leave the house for work at 8:15 and I can drink it while i drive AND, it's still at a drinkable temperature after lunch if there's any left.So, my rating for Joulies with a standard ceramic, plastic, or Styrofoam cup is 2 stars.  With a good vacuum insulated steel mug it is a resounding 5 stars!  I'm buying the combo pack of joulies + Thermos Sipp mug with the Joulies logo for several people for Christmas this year! \n",

      " review: Below is my first review.  I wrote it only this morning.  Then I decided to listen to one of my audible books while waiting for an appointment and couldn't get my headphones to work.  I figure it was just me.  When I got home I did an internet search and found that there is a glich with the kindle touch where your ability to use the headphones is dependent on having a set of headphones that is compatible with the unit.  I have five sets of headphones and only one will work properly.  Unfortunately, they are my big headphones that I am not going to be carrying in my purse when I go out.  My apple earbuds don't work with it at all.  It doesn't mater if it is the ones with or without the mike.  My smaller boise in-ear headphones only work if the plug is loosely set in, where it can easily fall out.It kind of remides me of an old TV I used to have that had to be hit to work!\"I loved my old Kindle, and I didn't think I could love anything quite as much.  As I was preparing to go on a very long voyage I became paranoid thinking what it would be like to have my kindle go out on me, so I hurriedly bought a new one.  I was surprised that by the time I got home I was only using the new one.  Now my old one had been relegated to being the back up one.\" \n",

      " review: For starters, I'm a nurse so I know what human spacers cost and I know what a pediatric mask costs. The price I paid for this is much too high and I looked for the cheapest I could find. Yes, it has a neat little flapper that helps tell you your cat is breathing the medication into their lungs but it's still too pricey for what amounts to a human spacer with a pediatric mask attached.Actual use hasn't been much of a problem. A lot of the AeroKat advertising and &#34;testimonials&#34; where owners say that cats just walk up and get their medication? I believe them to be FAKE. I've had multiple cats all my life and have had to deal with Asthma, Cancer, thyroid issues, etc. and NO cat just takes their medication. It is ALWAYS a challenge. If you thought your cat was just going to let you put a mask on their face so they can breathe in medication, then either you were fooled by AeroKat's advertising or you fooled yourself.One simply has to get creative. Sit behind the cat, shake the inhaler, put it in the spacer and shoot and put it over their face. When they try to back out, they can't. My cat backs up one time now and stops.Having trouble seeing deep breathing from the flapper? Rub the cats chest just under the next. If you can feel or hear them sigh, they took one good, deep breath.It works fine. It just costs too much and I think AeroKat's &#34;testimonials&#34; are fake. \n",

      " review: This is not laugh out loud comedy unless this is the type of thing guys laugh over while chugging back a few beers. It's sad in its description of the women he dates and its sad in his thoughts and actions towards them. However at the end, almost as if to give this book some meaning, he tells us his sad tale of being alone and how he has finally found a woman he might want to have a real relationship with. Most men won't comprehend this part. They will fixate on the \"craziness\" of the women, most who have been harmed by men and are the way they are, because of this. I'm torn between thinking this is good writing or just a sad statement on the state of affairs between men and women and how it has gone oh so wrong. \n",

      " review: I rented Lockout last night via the Amazon Instant Videos, for only $0.99.  What a deal!  I watched in on my Kindle Fire.  I loved it!  As good asDie HardorEscape from New York?  Well no, but then again few films are.  My all time favorite movie is Die Hard, so expecting anything else to be better than that is expecting a bit much. However, I did enjoy this action thriller.  As my title says, I really think having a super good villian on par with Hans Gruber would have greatly helped this film.  The bad guys were okay, but just did not radiate the cool calm evil that Hans did in Die Hard.  As others have posted, sometimes events were a little bit too much, but the action and humor (one liners) made up for that.  Since I rented this movie my time expires later tonight.  I think I will invite my son over and see if he wants to watch it on my big HDTV via the PS3 before my \"time is up\".  At $0.99 Amazon almost forced me to rent this movie.  I will buy it in the future, either from Amazon Instant video, if I can catch it for under $5 or just get the DVD sooner or later and then use a program to convert the film to play on my Fire. \n",

      " review: With its piano black finish, \"touch screen and video playback\", and included quality headphones, on paper this tiny Mp3 player looks to have features valuable enough to justify its price. And, on paper, it does... But in actuality, it leaves me feeling unsatisfied...The fact that this player has expandable memory definitely counts in its favor. You can get up to 48 GB of total memory on this, depending on your model, and whether or not you choose to add a full 32 GB micro SD card to it. Being that I love having the freedom to swap out my memory, I truly appreciate that feature. The unit itself is also so diminutive as to comfortably fit into the palm of an average-sized woman's hand - another nice thing, but something to keep in mind, as well, with regards to the possibility of losing this (as I did for a while, at one point! ; )  )!The X-Fi Crystallizer software that comes loaded on this unit also helps to sharpen the sound that it puts out, and, working in conjunction with the great-sounding headphones that come bundled with the unit, these two features make for a great audio experience...But, where the negatives come in are the \"touch screen\" and \"video playback\", as well as the simple inconvenience of the way-too-long load times when it comes to startup of the unit. The touch screen on this really amounts to no more than the buttons that allow you to scroll forward, backwards, play a track, pause a track, or stop a track, and the video playback is just laughable. Not only is the screen miniscule, the video playback on mine was just not the quality that I'm looking for when there are so many Smart Phones out there that can do exactly what this Mp3 player can do, and at immensely improved quality.Add to that the fact that this little unit seems to take forever and a day to load up the media every time you start it up, and is slow to shut down, and I just find myself without the patience to put it to use very often.The FM radio feature would come in handy in a pinch (such as a post-Hurricane power outage situation where the need to access radio stations truly arises), and the Bluetooth connection feature does add an extra bell and whistle, but really, not enough for me to say that this little player would be better suited to anyone much older than 10 years... I can see making an appreciated gift of one of these to a third grader, but anyone much older than that might find themselves wishing they'd gotten an i.... Uhm, something ELSE in the way of an Mp3 player.Sound quality is great, features are smart, but execution just leaves me with a bad taste in my mouth, and I'VE been a die-hard anti-Apple consumer for many, many years....Just not my cup of tea... \n",

I really liked the Kirkland Science Labs version because of the extra nutritional values it included without having to take additional pills.

But I think it will get cleaner with each use.  I have deep grout joints though, so it might work better for shallow ones.  The steam is really, really hot and blasts out with good pressure.  The trigger sends a quick blast out the front for stuck on stains.  I haven't tried it on carpet yet but my expectations there are significantly lower.

      " review: I used to own a gaming computer that cost over $1500. I built it back in 2009 and these were the specs: Phenom 965, 4gb ddr 1333, 2 x 4890 gpu, crosshair iii  formula motherboard, 2 x 1TB HDD, Blu Ray Drive, 1200W PSU. I also have the VW266H HD monitor and Z5500 sound system. My gaming computer worked for 1 year then started to experience major component failures. First, my 1200W power supply failed then one of my 4890 graphics cards failed. I replaced the PSU but when the Graphics card failed, I decided I'd had enough. I sold the remaining computer components but kept my HD monitor and Z5500 sound system. For a year I used a netbook to perform basic computing tasks and I hooked it up to my HD monitor to increase my productivity at times. During this time, I missed the joys of HD gaming and movies.There was a gap in my HD setup. I had an HD display and HD sound but no HD system do deliver HD content to these components. During the black friday sale, I saw this PS3 bundle as well as the XBOX 360 kinect bundle on sale for $200. I ended up purchasing this PS3 bundle and I can say that I've made the right choice.Right out of the box, the PS3 proved to be the perfect companion to my HD setup. I connected it to my HD monitor via HDMI and to my Z5500 via optical cable. I had 160 GB of storage and the ability to play blu ray movies (unlike the XBOX bundle). I was also pleased to see that the PS3 could stream HD movies via Netflix. I thought I wouldn't like the included games as they were 'kids games' but little big planet 2 proved to be lots of fun. I also bought metal gear solid 4, street fighter iv arcade edition and saints row 3. I only got one controller with the system but I was pleased to see that a PC controller worked with the system. Yeah, that's right, a Logitech wireless game controller. I just plugged the receiver into the USB port on the PS3 and it began working instantly. I was able to play 2 player fighting games with my friends using the PC controller and it worked perfectly. My USB keyboard and mouse also worked on the system and this made typing messages and chatting on the system much easier.I must say that this system surpassed all my expectations. I used to think that you need to spend over $1000 to get this kind of HD entertainment. This PS3 is just as much fun as my gaming PC at just a fraction of the cost (it costs less than I paid for my motherboard or one of my graphics cards or my processor). Netflix, Blu ray movies and HD gaming are just some of the features that make the PS3 worth far more than its price. Also, the use of Blu ray media means that game developers are not constrained by disc size (as with other game consoles). I read about some games being over 40 gigs in size.If you haven't already bought one of these, don't hesitate. It's the best value for money in the game console arena. \n",

Confucius argued that the relationship between country and government is like that of a son to father relationship, where the son (society) obeys the government and the father (the government) takes care of the society.  The only thing I would have changed, is to call the relationship a co-equal marriage between two, non-gender specific individuals; a society influencing and following the laws of a government, and a government being influenced by and tending to and obeying the needs and wants of a society, in accordance with empirical effects and natural law.Highly intuitive, eons ahead of his time, and a royal shame that he is not followed more carefully and precisely in his own native society, let alone, in all societies around the world. \n",

The fact that God and the United States of America, the land of the free, played such an important part in their decision to escape in the daring way that they did. Those men absolutely know without a doubt, what freedom means and what it takes to achieve it and keep it.I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in real life stories with adventure, beliefs, trust, and the desire for freedom and much more.I'm hoping that maybe there will be a producer/director out there that will read this book and see it as great material for a movie or documentary.I wish them both many blessing and much success for the future. \n",

      " review: Jennifer Lynne - Educating Ethan  {Reviewed by Aggie @ Hearts On Fire Reviews}Educating Ethan probably should have been called \" Educating Ida \" because in this short story the heroine has to throw away all preconceived notions she has about what it means to be involved with a younger man, and face the fact that age differences should not be (for the most part, anyway) a deciding factor in whether or not a relationship can be successful.Ida is a thirty-six year old caterer and divorcee living in Melbourne, Australia. She is also a pretty bad spy. Peeping from behind the white curtains of her window, she lustfully gawks at Ethan Holt, her twenty-five year old new neighbor, as he picks up moving crates and settles into his new home.The two become acquainted when he spots her oogling him and decides to go to her front door and introduce himself. She just so happens to have sticky buns in the oven (heehee) and she offers him one while they flirt, get to know each other, and she tries not to eye his package and fantasize.Educating Ethan wasn't what I expected. Many readers will find this \" cougar-pup \" tale sweet and innocent, with enough sexiness and sex to satisfy. I wanted a bit more. I liked Ethan fine. He was the typical younger man, slightly cocky, with the nice eyes and physique that would attract any older woman with a libido. He liked Ida and was really into her. Ida, on the other hand, was more irksome for me. She was dwelling on the age difference, which really isn't that much. Eleven years. If she were sixty-two and he was twenty-two, I'd say yeah, dwell on it. Be disturbed, even. But it wasn't the case here. She was acting motherly to him when at worst she was more of a big sister.I guess I wanted Ida to be a cougar, not a kitten. I wanted her to attack him when he came to her door. Pull him into her house by the shirt collar and ravage him!!! But she was full of self-doubt and had low self-esteem. And even though her reason for the self-doubt was nicely explained, and I understand it, being that I am of the female persuasion, it shouldn't (in my mind) take three years to over come the emotional beat down of a stupid ex-husband.Sadly, this was a slight miss for me. It is not an inherently bad read. Just rather weak. No real conflict or suspense. In addition, I didn't understand the reference to someone moving to Omaha, Nebraska when the story is set in the land of kangaroos and koalas. That was sort of bizarre.That said, I would try another book by Ms. Lynne to see how it compared to Ethan. \n",

Trust me on this one.After the first use and trying to disconnect with pliers and much hassle, I finally removed and then added a quick connect and that solved the issue.  I highly recommend you buy a hose quick connect for less than $10 to save you time and hassle.  Other than that it works great and you will be happy with this pressure washer. \n",

The pockets are very useful sizes and close with either snaps or zippers, so nothing will fall out.  There are sufficient large pockets (fit an iphone with case, gps, small bug spray) and some als plenty of smaller ones. There are also pockets on the back - one large enough to fit my 1 liter vapor water bottle.  The mesh is cool and pretty sturdy.  This is so much better than a backpack for hiking, camping.  Can close across vest if you want.  I wish it was just a little longer (I am 5'2&#34; and this comes just below my waist.  The collar is nice and not scratchy.

      " review: Updated March 10, 2013Below is my original review of the product, which I gave 2 stars. Have upgraded to 3 and may raise higher.  After commenting about the short length of the hose to attach to an upright vacuum, the company contacted me directly and very quickly.  They appear to be very interested in resolving customer concerns and approach it as a way to improve the product.  At no time, did I feel the company tried to tell me I was doing something wrong.  They promptly sent a much longer hose that works great.  They have followed up with emails, asking for input.  I haven't used this long enough to give it higher ratings.  From what I've read about the competeting products, I'd still go with this product first.  It can not break down, there are not ongoing costs for new parts.  The customer service is outstanding.  I haven't asked, nor do I want a refund.  My guess is, if I wanted to return it, the company would do  so without question.  These are really nice people, that are interested in improving the product and making sure their customers are satisfied.  For me, not providing a higher rating is I'm not sure if home micro really has an effect; time will tell.  If you want to give home micro a try; forget the hassles that are raised in the competing product reviews.  Just start with this product to give micro a test drive. This is simple, low cost, and great customer service.Below is my original review:I was very interested in trying out a home microdermasion machine. Put some serious effort into researching the reviews. Decided that the 2 more popular machines that have vacuum/suction seemed to be prone to problems. Even though they have a fair share of good reviews, I decided I didn't need the hassle.  I found this device on another website, came to Amazon and the reviews seemed promising. Decided to give it a try. My unit came directly from Amazon. Ordered it on a Saturday, it was delivered on the following Tuesday with free shipping.The reason for the low rating. There just isn't enough info in product description on Amazon or the product website.  I liked the idea of not having to pay for the vacuum function, and more importantly not having to deal with potential break down issues in the future.  However, the product description isn't specific enough about what size of vacuum hose it fits.  From the instruction sheet:  fits 1.25 inch round outlet. There is an adaptor that helps a bit. The hose must be round,  a Dyson will not work.If you get the basic component the microdermasion head that goes directly on the vacuum hose, keep in mind that you will be holding a 1+ inch hose in your hand while your trying to do a self microdermabrasion; that's pretty thick. Additionally, you are going to need to do the procedure while trying to manage a vacuum hose; they aren't the most flexible things.  Then there's the sanitary issue.  The instructions are very clear that use wash and put alcohol on your skin before you start.  But, you're using one hand to hold a vacuum hose that is cleaning throughout your house.  I suggest you might want to consider this.  Now, this product is available with a vacuum; you might want to consider that. Also there are some excellent small vacs on Amazon in the $35 range. The unit I ordered has a flexible hose about 15 inches long. It's too short to avoid having to hold the vacuum hose too. My vacuum hose is larger, but the adapter helps but won't keep the device's hose and vacuum connected without me holding it.  So, to do a procedure I need to hold the vacuum hose and try to manipulate the tip. Even if the pieces go together well, the provided hose is too short to just let a the vacuum hose hang there.  You do need to support it or the weight will make doing the procedure really difficult; if not, unsafe...possibility of scratching the skin.This product seems to have been designed when most people had canister vacs.  Any upright will probably have some issues. I suggest that before ordering this product that you take your vacuum to the area where you would be doing the procedure, take the hose and bring close to your face and see what control you have and ability to perform the procedure as shown in the Youtube videos.  Also, get a sense of how you feel about the sanitation issue of having the vac hose so close to you.  If you order the model with the extension hose, the vac hose will still be about 15 inches away.This product is a really good idea, they need to think it out a bit more.  At a minimum add more length to the provided hose.  I haven't returned the product yet. I've ordered a small vac with the right size hose to only use with this product. \n",

      " review: Saw the media hype posted on May 13th about Amazon Coins being the company's new virtual currency going live here in the U.S. As a frequent purchaser of Kindle editions and various business & photo apps, this one sounded interesting, especially with the announcement that Amazon had announced that it would put 500 coins, which are worth $5.00 worth in real currency, and the email message that followed shortly after noon today confirmed this.TheseAmazon Coinscan be used for purchasing \"Kindle Fire apps, games and in-app items from Amazon.\" On the upside, for frequent purchasers, the more coins that one buys, the greater the savings, starting with 500 coins offering a 4% savings, and 1000 coins going for a 5% discount. The discounts climb, with 5,000 and 10,000 coins offering a 10% savings. And the coins that one purchases are quickly deposited into your account, and have no expiration date.This started off looking like a real 5-star, so I bought into it. Read on...Though I had my 500 free coins, I weighed the discounts and bought the1000 Amazon Coinsoffer, giving me a total of 1,500 coins, and then I went shopping to see what I could find among a number of items that I had been considering. There in the Appstore I found thePhotoStage Photo Slideshow Maker App, with its $4.99 regular price. This one showed that it was compatible with my Kindle Fire HD 8.9\", original Kindle or my Samsung Galaxy S III, so it seemed to be a good deal. I could spend 499 Amazon Coins, leaving me with a balance of 1,001 coins from my original 1,500 coins (the freebie plus the purchase), and that showed up in the upper side of the app window, making it easy.But then the 'other side of the coin' appeared, so to speak...I went to explore the books, the Kindle editions, and that's where I found the weakness in this Amazon Coins program: the Kindle editions, the ebooks that so many of us read do not qualify for this program. If I want Syl Arena's excellentLighting for Digital Photography, it will be a regular purchase, and the Amazon Coins do not apply, which is a disappointment. The MP3 music albums are not eligible, nor are videos, at least at the time of this review.This is when what had appeared to be a 5-star program plummeted to a middle of the road 3-star offering from Amazon: on the star scale, it's OK... nothing more and nothing less.There will be some who disagree with this review, and mine is a viewpoint based on short personal experience with this product/service in which I wanted to explore the possibilities of whether or not it was worth it. As you can see, I went through the steps and even bought extra coins to find out how the process went. For what it is, I personally have no complaints or regrets, but unless it is expanded by Amazon, don't know at this stage if I'll buy any additional coins once mine are gone.Summary:For families with a number of children who use a lot of game apps, this Amazon Coin program may be a good thing, and for this user of photo and business apps I can see using them, at least for the short term; beyond that, I don't know. And users considering this should also take a look at the rather lengthy 'Amazon Coins Terms and Conditions' which fully describe that there are both Promotional Coins, which have an expiration date, and Purchased Coins, which do not expire. I've posted a link to this within the comments here, but it can also be found on the product page.For some, thisAmazon Coinsprogram will be good. For frequent purchasers, any discount can add up over time. But for those of us who are looking for a widespread plan including Kindle editions, videos music and more, the program is sorely lacking. Whatever you decide, be sure to read the published terms.5/13/2013 \n",

      " review: Zombies are all the rage these days.  Why, it seemed like just yesterday that vampires were en vogue, what with the TWILIGHT film series in full hype.  Werewolves?  Meh.  They've gone to the dogs.  Today, the best scares are found in the ranks of the undead.  Even AMC TV is getting into the craze with its stellar \"The Walking Dead\" program.  I guess it was only a matter of time before some enterprising filmmakers figured out it was time to revisit the depths of history for some previously unexplored moments in our zombie past.  You can bet the primary merchants of evil - the Nazis - experimented on re-animating flesh.  After all, what possible malevolence didn't those dastardly villains exploit?(NOTE: the following review will contain minor spoilers necessary for the discussion of plot and characters.  If you're the type of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then feel free to either read elsewhere or skip down to the last two paragraphs for my final assessment.  However, if you can accommodate a modest hint of things-to-come, then read on.)The time is March, 1941, approximately half a year before the Japanese would attack Pearl Harbor and draw America into the Second World War.  Captain Martin Stone (played by Andrew Tiernan) heads a small squad of American soldiers alongside a contingent of Finnish men on a classified mission to destroy a secret Nazi bunker.  But before you can say \"about face,\" the platoon is shattered by gunfire.  Before the night is over, Stone and the remaining survivors will have to join forces in battling the world's greatest threat: Nazi zombies!The film opens with a written script that claims that Nazis experimented on the recently deceased in 1939.  Furthermore, the text implies that members of the Finnish Army joined forces with the Americans to destroy the bunker involved in the research.  Thankfully, that's all they claim as true because it's clear very early on that there's little else even remotely possible between the opening and closing credits.  WAR OF THE DEAD is best left to what it is: pure, exploitative escapism.  On that level, there's absolutely nothing wrong with it ...Well, except maybe that not a lot of WAR makes any literal sense.Written and directed by Marko Makilaakso, WAR basically meanders from one action piece to another - all of them set in the dead of night with very little light but more than a fair share of flash and bang - and, as a consequence, this is only a thrill ride.  It's meant to be experienced, cheered, and (mostly) forgotten ... which is good because Makilaakso - while clearly an accomplished director - pretty much gets low marks as a writer.The primary problem I had with the story (and, yeah, maybe I think about things too much) is that, see, they're `zombies' only they're not.  Zombies - in their most primal state - are dead.  Or is that the undead?  I'm not even sure Makilaakso knows.  They're essential mindless animals who are reduced to foraging for flesh or brains (depending upon their tastes).  Their own mind only exists to pilot what remains of their body; I know this to be true because once they're separated from it, they're no longer a threat.  However, Makilaakso's \"dead\" possess the basic attributes of zombies, but they also seem to have an almost superhuman strength whenever the director or the script requires it.  Yes, they do go down from a bullet or a serious blow to the head, but that's all they bear in common.  Otherwise, as the undead, they still pretty much function as soldiers, often seen climbing trees, clambering up buildings and over roofs, and fist-fighting.To complicate matters further, they seem to also retain some form of human emotions, or so we're lead to believe.  For example, the Finnish Captain Niemi - once he's been bitten and successfully smitten with zombiehood - maintains a personal quest for vengeance against his counterpart, Captain Stone.  How or why does this happen?  Well, we're never told.  Apparently, director Makilaakso has no problem with screenwriter Makilaakso's script, and he never asked himself to hash it out logically.There are other (many!) blemishes to the story that makes it to the screen, but I won't belabor the point.  As I said, I think it very clear that WAR was intended to be little more than a scarefest, and, on that level, it's moderately successful.  It's certainly front-loaded with some excellent camera work as the viewpoint is almost constantly in motion.  While it's all impressive to look at, I would've preferred that someone else had taken a hatchet to the script and produced something that, marginally, added up to something more than what was delivered.  In fact, several events simply happen - Stone and Niemi's major showdown, a kinda/sorta love interest, and an ending that sadly comes out of nowhere and really needed further explanation - and we're none the wiser for trying to figure this all out on our own.I've read others (Ain't It Cool News and Fangoria, specifically) heap mountains of praise on the film, and they're perfectly within their rights to do so.  It all looks grand.  Too bad it all felt so empty.WAR OF THE DEAD is produced by Accelerator Films, Lietuvos Kinostudija, Media One Entertainment, and Rialto International.  DVD distribution is being handled by Entertainment One (eOne).  As for the technical specs, most of it looks and sounds very impressive, though there was a brief sequence photographed in a makeshift ventilation duct that was fairly poorly lit - thankfully, it doesn't last long.  How disappointed was I to learn that the disc came without a single special feature except for the theatrical trailer?  BOOYAH on you, filmmakers!  You could've given us something to look at besides all of the World War II glamor, couldn't you?RECOMMENDED but don't be fooled: all that glitters is not gold, and WAR OF THE DEAD glitters plenty.  Unfortunately, there's very little substance once the style is peeled away, and very little of the story makes any sense.  Still, it's a respectable B movie that serves up probably enough scares and war-time action for a no-brainer - a Friday night diversion when there's nothing else on the tube - that could end up being a guilty pleasure to the right crowd.  Have fun with it, but, for Pete's sake, don't think about it too much.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Entertainment One (eOne) provided me with a DVD screener of WAR OF THE DEAD by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review. \n",

      " review: Overall, this series of books was an enjoyable read. I grant that advancements came faster than a speeding bullet, humanity learned to leap tall buildings in a single bound, and technical abilites advances to the point that humanity became the dominant species of the universe in a matter of a relativley few years. It doesn't get to cute in defining all these advancements; that would lead to complications in the telling of the yarns and give fodder to those who like to criticise the details.What does all this matter, anyway, when the objective of the author is to spin a yarn on a grand scale.While the belivability of the whole thing strains the imagination, that doesn't detract from it being a fun read and I enjoyed the series overall. This last book did a pretty good job of wrapping it up so that a fifth tale isn't needed. That's fine, because it went on long enough to make its points. \n",

      " review: The works included on this disc -- Beethoven's 'Archduke' Trio, the 'Kakadu' Variations, and the early E Flat Piano Trio, WoO 38 -- have all been recorded numerous times, and the recorded competition is stiff. For instance, there are wonderful performances by the Beaux Arts TrioBeethoven: The Piano Triosand by superstars like Ashkenazy, Perlman and Harrell, e.g.Beethoven: Piano Trios, Vol. 1; Itzhak Perlman; Vladimir Ashkenazy; Lynn Harrellor Barenboim, du Pr&eacute; and ZukermanDaniel Barenboim, Pinchas Zukerman & Jacqueline du Pr&eacute; - Beethoven: Piano Trios. It's a brave thing, then, for this less-known piano trio, the Xyrion Trio, to record this material. The members of the trio are two Americans long resident in Germany, violinist Ida Bieler and pianist Nina Tichman, and a German who trained in the US, cellist Maria Kliegel. Indeed they have, in various combinations, recorded a great deal for the Naxos label and have established their bona fides. Their performances here are fine. Their playing tends to be a bit less assertive than some others, but they are deeply musical for all that. Among the highlights on this disc are the slow movement of the 'Archduke' which is achingly beautiful, and the delicately charming Scherzo from the early (and not well-known) E Flat trio.For those who are not familiar with these trios, a word or two. The 'Kakadu' Variations, which leads off the CD, was written in 1803 and revised in 1816. It is based on a comic song from an operetta by Wenzel M&uuml;ller in which a sly apprentice tailor wins the girl. His song is 'Ich bin der Schneider Wetz und Wetz/Bin g'reist durch d'halbe Welt' ('I am the tailor, sharp and sharp/I have traveled through half the world'). Immediately after the operetta premiered in 1794 this song became a popular tune with the lyrics changed to 'I am the tailor Kakadu' ('Cockatoo'). In fifty years or attending concerts I have never heard this piece live, but have heard probably half a dozen recordings.The Piano Trio in E Flat, Without Opus Number 38, was written in Bonn about 1790 but not published until it was found in Beethoven's papers after his death. It is Haydnesque, even before Beethoven studied with Haydn, in that the piano part is by far the dominant voice as in all of Haydn's many piano trios.The best-known work here is the magnificent 'Archduke' Trio, written for one of Beethoven's pupils, the Archduke Rudolph, in 1810. At its premiere Beethoven, whose deafness was already far advanced, played the piano part and at least one audience member (the composer Louis Spohr) said that the piano was badly out of tune and that Beethoven's fortissimi were so loud that the strings jangled. Beethoven played in public only a few times after this performance.Scott Morrison \n",

      " review: Even after reading the reviews that warned me that this sequel was not as good as 300, I chose to rent it anyway. I guess on a certain level it was mindless entertainment. However, it falls far short of the original in almost all ways. I think the overall plot was  compelling, but it lacked that &#34;epic&#34; moral quality that made 300 a far better movie. Anyway - if you are looking for mindless, gratuitous violence with blood splatter and body parts flying - this is the movie for you. Also, I was a bit disappointed regarding the explicitness of the sex scene. I think the producer really walked the line on this and it could easily have been rated as an adult flick. \n",

      " review: They caught me in a weak moment.  I was walking through Sam's Club when I encountered a very pleasant young guy selling these ClingSweep Plus things 'for a limited time only.'  I'd never heard of them before and the little demo that the fellow did on a table seemed impressive enough.  He assured me that this was just the thing for our household of kids, two dogs, and cat.  Then he *sweetened* the deal by offering me two boxes for the price of one ($40).  Gullible me.  My only relief is that there was an additional deal of three boxes for $50 which I turned down...so at least I didn't waste an additional $10.Each box contains a large (7.75\" wide) lint roller with an extendable handle for floor use, a medium-sized (nearly 4\" wide) hand-held roller, and two tiny fold-up rollers for purse or luggage.  The cleaning surface of these lint rollers is a bright-red, sticky gel-like substance.  They're marketed as being able to effectively clean both carpet and hard flooring.  Rather than the typical lint rollers with peel-off sheets to refresh the stickiness, these ClingSweep cleaners are simply washable and reusable.  You can either swish it around in a bucket to remove embedded hair/dirt or you can put it under a running water faucet (probably not the best option if you have pet hair that will go down the drain).  The two larger rollers have covers to keep them completely clean and lint-free between uses.  The purse-size units fold into a cover to protect their stickiness.The thing is...they really are quite sticky and able to pick up pet hair, lint, and small crumbly stuff.  And they're sticky without leaving gummy residue on your hands, flooring, furniture, etc.  Sounds pretty good, right?  So what's the problem?  After one or two sweeps of the floor roller, it's full and no longer sticky enough to pick up anything else.  We're talking at best a 3'x3' section.  So you have to wash it off (water bucket or under faucet).  And here is the problem.  The roller has to be dried *fully* in order for it to become sticky again.  You can try to speed the drying with a towel, but it has to be a totally lint-free towel or else you're back to square one.  At this rate, it would take me hours to do one room.Perhaps for households without large dogs, these would work better.  However, even with very frequent vacuuming of our wood/slate floors, doing the occasional \"touch-up\" with the ClingSweep gave the limited results mentioned above.I would have given this ClingSweep Plus only 1 star, but I decided to add a star because it really is a decent lint roller for clothing and small sections of furniture.  Rather than the floor, I run the floor roller over the surface of the duvet covers in the bedrooms to remove lint, hair, and fur.  I also use the floor unit for the furniture.  The medium-sized furniture roller is used for clothing instead.  And, heck, since I have the extra *free* box, I now have a total of 8 lint rollers (including purse-size ones).  But, I'm still kicking myself for spending $40 when an old cheap $4-5 lint roller would have done the trick.  Oh, well. \n",

It proved to be a MAJOR SPACE SAVER & a great & fast way to cook burgers, hot dogs, chicken & steak.  My only complaint is design of the drip tray.  Due to the poor design, it requires you to shift the grill pan so far to the right to accommodate the drip tray, that the surface of the grill pan is off center enough that you loose prime heating/cooking surface.  Given the compact size of the system, it can make a difference if cooking for more than 2 people. \n",

      " review: As other reviews have mentioned, it would be nice for a &#34;Home and Travel&#34; charger to have folding prongs. I can't hold that against this charger, as a look on the manufacturer's web site shows this to be a &#34;Home Charger&#34; with no mention of travel as an attribute. I have submitted a correction to Amazon so that the title on this site can be adjusted. That certainly doesn't keep you from tossing it in your gadget bag and taking on the road, travel-friendly attributes like foldable prongs and dual USB connectors keep it from being as useful as purpose-built devices.That said, there's nothing really to complain about with this charger. Its styling is non-objectionable, but I don't put much stock in styling when it comes to something like this. As long as it's not ugly and it fits in with other equipment in the area, I'm not going to complain.The obvious comparison is to the OEM Apple charger that comes with iPhones (smaller, cube-shaped) and iPads (larger, roughly the size of two of the Apple &#34;cube&#34; chargers side by side). This Belkin Mixit charger is larger than the cube charger, but roughly the same total size of the larger Apple charger (the Belkin is shallower as plugged into the wall, but slightly taller). The Apple cube charger is rated for 1 A @ 5 V, the Apple iPad charger is 2.4 A @ 5.2 V, and the Belkin is 2.1 A @ 5 V. As such, it should charge an iPad faster than the cube (which isn't designed to charge the iPad), but just a little slower than the Apple 12W charger.I measured current draw from the Belkin charger while charging an iPad 2 at 10% capacity at 0.18-0.19 A (9.9-10.0 Watts). This matched the current draw when using the larger Apple charger. It was also nice to see that the Belkin drew such a small current when no device was connected that it didn't register on my Kill-A-Watt P4400 meter, so you don't have to worry about vampire draws when not charging.Given that this charger is currently about $20 and the Apple iPad charger is $19, and the latter model has foldable prongs, I would go with that one instead. To better differentiate it from the OEM Apple charger and to add some value, foldable prongs and dual USB connectors would be an excellent addition. However, if you absolutely must have a charger with the styling offered by this model, I don't think you could be disappointed with this item. It's a charger, and it charges, and it doesn't have anything wrong with it. \n",

When choosing any type and kind of battery, you can determine its value bu dividing the price by the AH (ampere hour) or mAH (milli ampere hour) rating of the battery.  This quick math tells the buyer how much battery capacity costs and how it compares with other batteries.  For example, a 2200mAH battery that costs $22.00 equates to $0.01 per mAH.  A 1200mAH battery that sells for $14.00 equates to $0.0116 per mAH, which is more money per mAH, making the more expensive battery the better buy.

I can buy one Sawyer mini which will do 100,000 gallons of purified water or I could buy twenty or thirty other ceramic replacement filters to do less than what one of these will do.  One Sawyer mini is almost half the price of one MSR ceramic filter.  Like I said it's a no-brainer cost wise and after watching several YouTube videos on it I was sold.  Plan on attaching it to my platypus big zip 3 liter bag with a quick connect so I can gravity feed right into my reservoir without having to remove it out of my backpack, or straight fill into my water bottle.  So versatile you can even use it straight as a sipping style system for a quick drink.  Fantastic system, hope the guy that designed/invented it makes a fortune and gets to enjoy life!

      " review: Everyone knows Manhattan Brass - and if they don't they should. This is one of most inventive polished performing groups around today. They take us through the holidays with a wink and a few twists on new works and some very clever arrangements that make this album one of the finest of the season.Manhattan Brass is best known for its innovative programming, dynamic performances, varied, eye-opening repertoire, and commitment to educating audiences of all ages about live music and the brass idiom. Currently in its 19th season, the ensemble is an amalgam of individual virtuoso musicians, each bringing to the table their unique experience and vision. Comfortable in every genre from Gesualdo to jazz, the quintet is intent on taking brass ensemble playing to another level and bringing their audience with them. The styles are all over the map...Christmas in New York is never monocultural - reggae, classical, gospel, straight ahead jazz, calypso, Italian waltz, classic ballads, etc. Composers and nods to composers include Thelonious Monk, Handel, Respighi, Mel Torme, Brubeck and more.The ensemble is Wayne du Maine - trumpet, Lew Soloff - trumpet, RJ Kelley - horn, Michael Seltzer - trombone, David Taylor - bass trombone, and Ann Ellsworth - hornThe tracks are as follows:It Came Upon a Midnight ClearWe Wish You a Merry ChristmasA Merrier ChristmasStuffy TurkeySiciliana (from Ancient Airs and Dances for piano, Set 1)The Christmas SongO TannenbaumJingle BellsGod Rest ye Merry GentlemenLil Drummer DudeJoy To The WorldThere is just no better way to jump into the holiday mood than to listen to this impeccably polished brass ensemble.

The products seems to vary on actual wattage, I have both a 7w and a 6.5 watt but they look the same.  I first tried them in my track lighting and went from 375w of incandescent to 35w of LED and these are brighter.  It does seem like a whiter light but that's ok with me, just different.  I also replaced CFL bulbs in my kitchen recessed lights (half the wattage) with these using a GU10 to screw adapter (from Amazon) and they work really well there.  No delay in warming up and again are actually brighter.  No failures yet so very happy with these.  I'll have to stay with CFL's in other lights until the bulb looking LEDs get cheaper. \n",

      " review: &#8220;You never know who the Lord will use. Perhaps one day, it will be you, Ruth&#8221;.  Through the line of Ruth, the Moabite, came Jesus Christ, the saviour of the world.Moody Publishers has graciously provided me with a complimentary copy of this book, via Netgalley, in exchange for an honest review.  Thank you!At the market a young Moabite, Ruth, meets the Israelite, Naomi, and the two become fast, if unlikely, friends.  Ruth soon catches the eye of Naomi&#8217;s son, Mahlon.  It is not long before they are married.  With Naomi, Mahlon, Chilion and Orpah, Ruth finally experiences acceptance and love, and her marriage to Chilion is a tender one.  It is also during this time when her new Israelite family teaches Ruth about the Lord, and as naturally as breathing Ruth comes to give her heart to the Lord as well.[&#8230;] Ruth prayed to the Lord with increasing frequency.  It wasn&#8217;t a calculated, well-examined decision.  She gave it no thought.  She made no conscious change of allegiance in her faith.  She just clung blindly to the One who seemed to bring her a strange kind of relief.A few years into their marriage, in illness takes Mahlon from Ruth, along with his brother, Chilion.  On the brink of starvation, Naomi makes the decision to return to her homeland, Bethlehem, where the harvest is bountiful.  Naomi releases Ruth and Orpah from their duties to her and bids them to return to their mothers&#8217; houses.  Orpah obeys, but Ruth refuses to leave Naomi in one of the most famous statements from the Bible: &#8220;Where you go, I will go.  Where you lodge, I will lodge.  Your people will be my people and your God will be my God&#8221; (Ruth 1:16).As a Moabite, a Caananite, Ruth is not welcome in Bethlehem.  The fact that she was once married to an Israelite does not endear her to the people of Bethlehem; on the contrary! &#8220;[It] only raises their ire more. She had no business marrying a son of Bethlehem&#8221;.Without any means of supporting herself and Naomi, Ruth is forced to glean: the poorest of the poor are allowed to follow the harvesters and pick up whatever wheat is dropped or left behind.  The Lord answers Ruth&#8217;s prayer for guidance and leads her to the field of Boaz &#8211; a cousin of Naomi.  Boaz, a fair master and faithful servant of the Lord, fears for Ruth&#8217;s safety in other fields, and not only allows Ruth to glean in his field but instructs her to glean only in his field.  He then charges his servants to intentionally drop more wheat for Ruth to glean in order for Ruth to provide for herself and Naomi.In his field, Boaz comes to see Ruth as a remarkable woman, far removed from the unsavoury reputation that Moabite women hold.  He finds her to be a patient and kind woman, brushing off the insults of others, never retaliating with harsh words of her own.  More than anything Boaz values Ruth&#8217;s visible love for the Lord.  Despite Ruth&#8217;s destitute status, Ruth and Boaz become tentative friends.  Ruth never ceases to be astonished by Boaz&#8217; character.  He is friendly, fair, compassionate and generous.  He treats his servants, and even her &#8211; a Moabite! &#8211; with kindness and respect.Ruth and Boaz fall in love with each other, but desperately try to hide their feelings.  Ruth believes she is not worthy of Boaz, and Boaz believes he is too old for Ruth.  Thank goodness for Naomi&#8217;s interference, for these two are too stubborn to get out of their own way!Before they can settle into their happily ever after, Ruth and Boaz must learn to surrender their fears to the Lord and trust Him above all else.In The Field of Grace is fourth book by Tessa Afshar, and is a sequel of sorts to my beloved Pearl In The Sand.  It tells the story of Salmon and Rahab&#8217;s son, Boaz, and his Ruth; one of the most famous love stories in the Bible.As with her previous books, Afshar brings to life a well-known Biblical tale in a marvellously realistic way.  I feel like I've experienced indifference from a family in Moab, hostility from a community in Bethlehem, gleaned wheat in Boaz' fields, fallen in love with the perfect gentleman in an olive grove and found a love so pure it will be remembered for thousands of years.  The book of Ruth is a short one of only four chapters, but Afshar has managed to turn Ruth&#8217;s story into a very believable account of what Ruth&#8217;s life could have been like.As much as In The Field of Grace (and the book of Ruth) is about the love Ruth bears for Boaz, it is also about the love Ruth bears for her mother-in-law, Naomi.  Even after the death of her husband, Ruth refused to separate from Naomi.  Instead, she joined Naomi in a move to Jerusalem, a place where she knew she would be unwelcome at best.  Ruth&#8217;s love for Boaz and her love for Naomi carry equal weight in this telling, a very clever touch, as historically Ruth is as well known for her love for Naomi as she is for her love for Boaz.  My only complaint in this regard (and it is a tiny one) is that Ruth and Boaz only meet approximately 25% into the book &#8211; I adore Boaz and I love him and Ruth together, so this complaint is just me being greedy and wanting even more of them.I find it wonderfully poetic that Boaz falls in love with - and marries - a Caananite who came to love Jesus, much like his father and mother.  Rahab&#8217;s pearl earrings also make their way into the tale of Ruth and Boaz&#8217; romance; a lovely touch by the author that made me extremely happy.I love all the colourful characters in the book.  Ruth is wonderful; her legendary courage and loyalty is brought to life so beautifully.  Likewise, the character of Boaz is every inch the perfect gentleman, tender and kind &#8211; just like the Bible portrays him.  I felt very frustrated by Naomi at times, but I think in that the author illustrated just how bitter Naomi had become after the death of her husband and sons, and how Ruth&#8217;s love and God&#8217;s grace ultimately healed her hurts.  I adore Dinah and Adin and wish there was even more of them!Tessa Afshar has become one of my favourite authors, flawlessly bringing life to tales from the Bible.  I eagerly anticipate each of her new books, and she doesn&#8217;t let me down.  I don&#8217;t know what Afshar plans to write next, but I am still clinging to hope for a book about Lysander and Roxanne (from Harvest of Gold).  Here&#8217;s hoping :)Full review: [...] \n",

So with great expectations, I began 'Souls Entwined'. I was not disappointed. It was a wonderful read.Set in two spaces of time, the present day and the Aegean Sea in 1829, it quickly caught my attention. We begin with our character, Sam, whose attention is grabbed by a lady jogger he refers to as Purple Shorts. Can you just guess what she might be wearing? A falling tree and a mysterious cat in the mist and--Pow!--Sam and Purple Shorts(--aka Gretta--)are transported back to 1829 where they entwine with Lorenzo and Anya.We get  pirates, cursed treasures, a purgatory pit and a fairy tale book full of pirate's codes. All are mysterious bits of the puzzle rooted in a ring Gretta wears. A very old ring.Gretta and Sam make repeated trips to entwine with Lorenzo and Anya to learn the secrets of that ring and the curse that has sent generations of women from Gretta's family to the purgatory pit. The emotional twists that fate had in store for the young lovers had me brushing the tears away one moment and gasping &#34;Oh no!&#34; the next. The clear cut division of love and attraction between Gretta & Sam and Anya & Lorenzo were well done.'Souls Entwined' is a book I recommend. It offers plenty for readers who like paranormal, historical or any of the genres mashed up within the lovely cover. \n",
